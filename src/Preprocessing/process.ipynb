My Facebook account was hacked six days ago. The hacker removed my email ID, and phone number, and changed my password locking me out of my account altogether. Despite trying various methods, even contacting Oculus Meta, I remained stuck in a loop of ID verification, temporary passwords, and codes without making progress.  \\n\\n\\n**Context:** This is specifically for people who have gotten to the STEP of Uploading ID/passport for identity verification! You need to try to log in from an old device like the Facebook app on your phone,  where your FB login name and Display picture is still shown, even though you have been hacked.  Or, you can try to troubleshoot this by typing your Facebook Name to find your profile.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The Solution:**\\n\\n1. **Change IP Address:** I read on Reddit that changing your IP address is key. After multiple failed attempts from my home, I called a friend for help to try this method. **The idea is to use a different email, laptop, and different IP address from a different location while following these steps.**\\n2. **Use a Different Email:** Once you get to verification, upload your ID as usual and use your friend\\'s email address, one that isn\\'t linked to any Facebook account.\\n3. **Change Location and Device:** Once your friend receives the usual email that Facebook sends saying, \"Thank you for confirming your identity\" with the temporary password, ask him to follow the steps on his laptop. Click on the link that says, \"Get Back to the Account\" with this laptop/IP address. **This step is crucial to break the verification loop.**\\n\\n**This is when the LOOP Breaks.** Now instead of the Usual log-in page that goes nowhere, the \"Secure your Login Details\" page shows up!!\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsezk76eqjwb1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=897ab45d5de998273cd0acb3de99555fcdcc3872\\n\\n1. **Restore Your Phone Number:**  Once you press Next,  you get an option to add the phone number previously removed by the HACKER. Ask your friend to add your number linked to your hacked account, and Facebook will send a code to your phone!\\n2. **Log In:**  Now, give the code you received on your device to your friend. Make him enter the code sent by Facebook to your phone number.\\n\\n**Now you get access to your Facebook Account! The next steps are crucial to take your account back from the Hacker:**\\n\\n1. **First, go to settings and have your friend add a new email address that is not linked to any Facebook account. You won\\'t be able to Remove the Hacker\\'s Email yet.**  To remove the hacker\\'s email, you\\'ll need your current password, which you don\\'t have.\\n2. Then, your friend can reset the password with the new email address. Facebook will send an email to the newly added address to change the password.\\n3. **Remove the Hacker\\'s Email:** With your new password,  your friend can remove the hacker\\'s email and details finally!\\n4. **Secure Your Account:** After removing the hacker\\'s email, ask your friend to add your phone number and new email, and set up two-factor authentication for added security.\\n\\nBy having your friend, family member or yourself conduct these steps on a different Laptop, location, and IP Address, you can successfully recover your hacked Facebook account and BREAK THE LOOP after submitting your ID with no results! **Good luck, and may this method help many others facing a similar situation!**', 'created_utc': '2023-10-26T19:27:47', 'num_comments': 1057, 'permalink': '/r/facebook/comments/17gwu52/successfully_recovered_hacked_facebook_account/', 'flair': 'Disabled/hacked', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Suddenly seeing more birthday wishes from my friends to their friends (who are unknown to me) ?', 'score': 340, 'id': 'qyccjr', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/qyccjr/suddenly_seeing_more_birthday_wishes_from_my/', 'author': 'kenauk', 'body': \"All of a sudden, I'm seeing a whole bunch of birthday wishes from my FB friends to their FB friends (all of whom I am not friends with on Facebook...basically I don't know them).\\n\\n[I don't know David, nor am I friends with him.](https://preview.redd.it/3tlyp7i4rs081.jpg?width=761&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f9f08aaec0a7c0bf62e66c17e1ef115ae428658)\\n\\nAnyone else notice this ?

Fun. \\n\\nNow I'm scared to post anything for fear of a ban or somebody unfriending me, fun!   \\n\\nI deactivated my account early this year because its just depressing to see what it became. \\n\\nAll my HS friends either deactivated, deleted or abandoned their accounts. \\n\\nFB ruined itself because it decided to become more authoritarian and private then what it set out to be. \\n\\nA place for people to connect and just be friends. \\n\\nNow what's the point? If you're like me and almost 30 you know all your friends from HS either have families now or don't use FB anymore and your family that isn't mom and pop is either dying/dead or disowned you for political reasons. \\n\\nDo you really want to log on to see Sarah from HS posting a photo of her 3rd baby from her 5th baby daddy? Or your cousin posting a picture of a sandwich for lunch? \\n\\nDo you really want your friends to hate you for posting about something you're passionate about? \\n\\nFacebook isn't fun anymore and definitely isn't even close to what it was in the early 2010s \\n\\nThere isn't anymore fun anymore. It feels like a prison you are forced to be happy in. \\n\\nWhy? Because you're looking though a window to other people's lives though a steel barred window while trapped in your own. \\n\\nPeople don't add anymore for fear of hacking or harassment and nobody checks message requests. \\n\\nYou can't even add strangers anymore unless you have 1 or 2 mutual friends\\n\\nThere is no more connecting. There is no more trust. \\n\\nFacebook is a shadow of what it used to be. \\n\\nSomebody once described FB as an abandoned theme park full of dead memories and honestly I think that's the most fitting description \\n\\nIf we never had FB I honestly think the world would've been a better place. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'created_utc': '2024-12-16T00:12:51', 'num_comments': 118, 'permalink': '/r/facebook/comments/1heyum6/its_really_depressing_to_think_about_what/', 'flair': 'Discussion', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': \"Meta's new hate speech guidelines permit users to say LGBTQ people are mentally ill\", 'score': 288, 'id': '1hyj31c', 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/meta-new-hate-speech-rules-allow-users-call-lgbtq-people-mentally-ill-rcna186700', 'author': 'Powerful-Dog363', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2025-01-11T05:55:30', 'num_comments': 162, 'permalink': '/r/facebook/comments/1hyj31c/metas_new_hate_speech_guidelines_permit_users_to/', 'flair': 'News Article', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Dear Facebook, please stop.

A 15 year old password that was part of hundreds of leaks that I had reused countless times does not provide much security. Honestly though, I thought that I had changed that password a while back. If you\\'re reading this, you\\'ve probably already realized you need to step up your personal security. I have been using Bitwarden and Authy since this, and I really like both of those so far.\\n\\nAnyways, my account got hacked Jan 8. I was on the road for work, and it was hacked early in the morning. I did not have a chance to immediately address the issue. The hacker changed my password, removed my email and phone number, and set up 2FA. I went through the usual password recovery methods and realized that the recovery email was not one that belonged to me. I tried the other suggestions on Facebook\\'s help pages, but as I\\'m sure you well know by now, Facebook customer support is not a thing. I tried using Trusted Contacts. This *almost* worked. I was able to access my account, but as I was clicking through the recovery screens, I got an error message saying the link I used was expired. Damn. I tried a couple more times, but got messages saying something about exceeding the # of attempts to recover in a day. The next day, Trusted Contacts is no longer an option. Instead, I go through the process of submitting an ID and an alternate contact email. And then I wait. And wait. And wait. I keep checking back, and all I ever see is, \"You have already submitted your ID. We will get in contact when we have a chance to review.\" Fast forward to a month later, I check back and get a new message. \"Your account cannot be recovered because we cannot confirm your identity.\" No further steps mentioned. No details or other options on how to confirm my identity - just a brick wall. I searched all over and found lots of people in the same boat who had just said, \"Forget it!\"\\n\\nNow what you actually came for. Here\\'s what worked for me:\\n\\nI realized that I have a free account, so I am literally worthless to Facebook. So how do you get their attention? Oculus (the virtual reality gaming platform) is owned by Facebook, and Facebook account is required to register and use an Oculus. And Oculus has live chat support. Without an account, they\\'ve just sold you a $300-$400 paperweight. Only problem, they don\\'t much care unless you have actually purchased an Oculus product and have a serial #. So I pull out my Target app, find the Quest 2, and purchase it for contactless curbside pick-up. Less than 2 hours later, I am back on chat support with my new Oculus serial number, and they are able to submit a direct request to Facebook support. Maybe an hour later, I finally get an email from Facebook support. They request identification, which I quickly supply, and almost immediately I receive back a link to recover my account! Facebook re-associated my account to my email address, and I was able to change my password. Bingo! Until I hit the hackers 2FA. It takes me to a page where I can bypass the 2FA by submitting an ID. (Wait, didn\\'t I already do this?!) I submitted that, and also sent another email back to Facebook support. After not hearing back for 24 hours, I responded again to the Oculus support ticket describing my issue. No less than an hour later, I get another email from FB with a link to bypass 2FA.\\n\\nI was able to successfully get back into my account, remove the hacker\\'s email address (which was cleverly chosen to mimic my own), disable the hacker\\'s 2FA, and reset everything with my own info. It doesn\\'t look like the hacker actually did much with my account while they had it, but I went though all of my groups, activity history, etc. to see what I could find or if there was any other damage control I needed to do.\\n\\nNow I\\'m set up with a unique, 12+ digit randomly generated password, 2FA, log-in alerts, and Trusted Contacts reset. I\\'ve gone though many of my online accounts and done the same with all of them. I use Facebook for communication, entertainment, and to connect with different communities and businesses, so for me, it was mostly just an annoyance. I know some people rely on it for business, and my have other important accounts connected to it. Regardless of how you use FB, I wanted to post my success story so that hopefully it can help of the other folks out who are having to deal with the same thing. If you\\'ve got any questions, feel free to post or message me. Dealing with FB has been a pain in the ass, and I would be glad to help.

I don't rely on Facebook for any 'facts', for me this move is just going to incentivize for trolls to spam the platform. I don't want to see that crap, I was just here to keep up with friends and family.\\n\\n\\nAs someone who made their account when I was 12 in 2007, it was an awesome, yet imperfect way to keep up with friends. Keeping connected to people you know was its sole purpose. I have Facebook to thank for marry my wife because it was how we kept in touch after meeting one night at camp. Honestly if Facebook stayed this way, I'd still love it. But greed took over as they found ways to make millions by hooking our attention through doomscrolling. Over the years it gradually started to steer of its original purpose to by the mid-2010's it had a become more of a marketing, media and news outlet, and no longer about fostering connection. Now ten years later if check my feed it's mostly ads, pages I don't follow, reels and weird Ai slop and less actual friends posting. \\n\\nI honestly think Zuckerberg doesn't care about Facebook, has little to no interest in social networking and just sees it as funding for his true passion, the Metaverse. If Zuckerberg did truly care about connecting people, he wouldn't have let it devolve to what it has become now. This past year everyone I know has abandoned Facebook and with this recent news more and more people are going to abandon it. Facebook has gotten him into countless lawsuits that I can imagine he no longer feels it's worth it.
