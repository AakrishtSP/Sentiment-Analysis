Beginners seems to have question on how to get started.  \\n  \\n\\n**THE BASICS**  \\n*Step 1:*  \\nGet a bank account. A class banks are preferable.   \\n*Step 2:*   \\nGet a DMAT account. Subsidiary capital of bank will create DMAT for you. Any branch will open a DMAT for you. NEVER get two DMAT accounts. Always have DMAT and Banks account of same Bank. Not necessary, but for ease. Eg. Saving account in Global IME, DMAT account in Global IME Capital etc.   \\nBank Account will have you money. DMAT will have your shares.\\n\\n*Step 3:*  \\nLink bank account and DMAT with C-ASBA. You need to fill C-ASBA form and submit it in any branch. You can fill C-ASBA form and link multiple bank accounts. If you have Global IME saving account, and Global IME Capital DMAT, submit C-ASBA form at Global IME Bank to link your bank account. If you have saving account at NMB and DMAT at Global Capital, submit C-ASBA at NMB to link C-ASBA.\\n\\n*Step 4:*  \\nSubmit MeroShare form. This enables to buy IPOs online. Also needed for WACC,EDIS and transferring shares. Meroshare can be used to change where your dividend goes. You can change account here. \\n\\n**Getting Started into Trading/Secondary market.**\\n\\nYou will need TMS account. TMS account is opened at broker/securities office. There are around 51. More or less all are same. TMS is where you put buy-sell order. Since TMS isn't integrated with you bank account, meroshare or DMAT, you need to manually settle transaction and transfer stocks.   \\nSanima Bank has Sanima 3in1 account which enables to buy-sell shares and is linked with your DMAT & bank account. Transactions are automatically done. You will still need to do EDIS manually though. \\n\\n**Some tips:**  \\n\\\\>Don't submit physical for opening bank account or TMS. First do online account opening and then visit bank for physical verification.   \\n\\\\>Get ConnectIPS for interbank transfer. It is cheaper and efficient compared to alternatives.   \\n\\\\>If you have queries or there are some issue always email!  \\n\\n\\nIPO = safe option. There is almost no loss.   \\nSecondary share/trading. Price goes up and down. Need Fundamental & technical analysis and you need to make sure if you are investing for long-term or short term.\", 'created_utc': '2020-12-31T20:15:07', 'num_comments': 50, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/knqx7r/how_to_start_investing_is_shares_beginners_guide/', 'flair': 'Misc', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Trying to buy the dip right now............', 'score': 126, 'id': 'o4y4z7', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/jidkagym3n671.jpg', 'author': 'berojgar_keto', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-06-21T21:30:53', 'num_comments': 12, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/o4y4z7/trying_to_buy_the_dip_right_now/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'It do be like that.', 'score': 124, 'id': 'm929hq', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/pxybdqi515o61.jpg', 'author': 'None', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-03-20T13:30:28', 'num_comments': 4, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/m929hq/it_do_be_like_that/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Finally..

Fixed income securities means that the income stream produced by these securities is fixed and will be known prior to investing or buying the units. Suppose a 5 years security that provides 8% interest on invested amount of 10000 means that the investor gets 800rs annually into their bank account for five years and then the amount they have invested which is 10000. So in 5 years the total income is 800+800+800+800+10800.\\n\\nDifference between debentures and FD :\\n\\nBoth are fixed income securities. Debentures in a naive language is an Investor giving loan to the company. If you buy 10000 worth 8 % debentures of NABIL bank, you are lending 10000 to NABIL bank and in return you will earn 8% interest every year and 10000 at the end of the agreement. Which is what a basic loan agreement is.\\n\\nBoth are low risk and low reward securities. But with FD you have an illiquid position while debentures can be traded . Liquidity means the ability to convert your assets into cash AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. If you invest in a FD for 1 year, you cannot terminate the contract without paying additional fees. Hence incase of an emergency you are stuck with money in FD unless you are willing to pay fines. And it's completely reasonable because banks have short and long sources of finance. If you sign a FD for 2 years, the bank utilises your money considering the fact that you will not be needing this money for 2 years. You invest in 2 years FD and suppose the banks gives this amount to another borrower for 2 years and you out of nowhere in 1 year you demand the money then the bank has to liquidate some of its other positions to give the amount to you. Hence you by not sticking to the contract promise, the bank has an opportunity cost, thus they charge you with fines. \\n\\nDebentures in the other hand can be traded and sold. Incase of an emergency, you can liquidate your debentures unlike FD.\\n\\nValue of debentures :\\n\\nValue of debentures depend upon the prevailing market interest rates. The par value is 1000 but it can be 900,or 1100 depending upon the interest rate. Let's say the market interest date today is 8% and your debentures provides 9%, which means that your debentures is a better yielding security than FD . If you sell your debentures today then you are basically giving up 9% return for 8 %. Hence you will only be ready to sell this debenture above its par value. Thus the value of your debentures will be 1100 (random number). In this case the terminology used is premium. We say the debentures are trading at PREMIUM . \\n\\nSimilarly, if the market rate is 10% but your debenture gives 8% return, no one will buy your debenture. Why? Because they can easily get 10% today while your debenture provides only 8%. Hence others will only agree to buy your debentures if you sell it at a price lower than par. This in this case your debentures will trade at below 1000 in the secondary market at 900 or anything below 1000. The terminology used here is discount. We say, the debentures are trading at a DISCOUNT. \\n\\nIn short there is inverse relationship between debentures and market interest rates. If market interest rates rise, your debentures will fall in value and vice versa.\\n\\nWho buys them?\\n\\nYou and me aren't only the ones investing. A larger portion of investors in any market are institutions like pension funds, insurance companies, banks, etc . For a pension fund, preservation of their fund is the first priority. They cannot risk investing in stocks because many people' s retirement plans will go bust in a bearish environment . For a life insurance company that sees liability later in years, the company has to have capital in place to meets its long term liabilities. Hence they cannot risk investing in stock market.\\n\\nFor many companies and institutions low risk low reward game is a must because preservation of capital is the first priority . Also regulatory authorities prohibit them from investing in risky position. Imagine a pension fund investing aggressively in stock market what if the market crashes? Aren't all the pension holders going to suffer?\\n\\nAlso if you have 2 crore lying around, debentures becomes a stable source of income for you without risking your 2 crore. With stocks, your 2 crore can be 4 crore in 2 year or 1 crore if market crashes. If you see an opportunity to buy a house you can immediately sell your 2 crore position and get the money but with FD you cannot do that unless you pay a fine.\\n\\nEdit : typos plus added some terminologies.\", 'created_utc': '2021-01-31T14:08:37', 'num_comments': 16, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/l984ql/all_about_debentures/', 'flair': 'Debentures/Bonds', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Yeah boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii', 'score': 109, 'id': 'o9eqxu', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/ypoow6rady771.jpg', 'author': 'funkyou0899', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-06-28T12:28:47', 'num_comments': 10, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/o9eqxu/yeah_boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Nepali market in general', 'score': 106, 'id': '1gw59md', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/j44kqmvfy52e1.jpeg', 'author': 'captainright1', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2024-11-21T07:57:55', 'num_comments': 23, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/1gw59md/nepali_market_in_general/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': '\"CaPiTaL GaIn TaX\"..........................', 'score': 102, 'id': 'nqdmm5', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/b41v9yx73s271.jpg', 'author': 'Nemesis-aak', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-06-02T10:31:57', 'num_comments': 6, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/nqdmm5/capital_gain_tax/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Company Analysis/Due Diligence on r/NepalStock every week... participation requested!', 'score': 103, 'id': 'pm0x0b', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalStock/comments/pm0x0b/company_analysisdue_diligence_on_rnepalstock/', 'author': 'JackThorne30', 'body': 'We are starting a new Weekly Company Analysis series on the sub-reddit.

(RADHI) declared a massive 36.5% bonus shares today the share market responded with 10% positive circuit increment. The company has an Annualized EPS Rs 17.63 and Net Worth Rs 151.85 per share as per the latest 3rd Quarter report of FY 2077-78.\\n\\nIf we look closely, we can see that the share price has already increased by more than 50% in last 20 days with high increase in volume, mainly as a result of insider trading.\\n\\n#Facts_of_the_Case\\n\\n1) The share price of the Company was hovering around Rs 150 per share since last few years and also until a few months ago when the price started to gradually increase. The closing price is 774 on 17.5.2021 and is expected to increase further.\\n\\n2) The entire dividend history of Co is as follows:\\nFY 2073-74 - 10% Bonus Share\\nFY 2074-75 - 5% Bonus, 5% Cash\\nFY 2075-76 - No Dividend\\n\\n3) There was gossips in some share market groups since the last few days that some big news of Radhi was coming resulting in more increase in its share price.\\n\\n4) The Company had Net worth per share of Rs 138.92 as per the 4th Quarter report of PY 2076-77 and declared 36.5% bonus shares for the FY 2076-77 on 17.5.2021. I.e the company has declared dividend to the maximum possible extent.\\n\\n5) In Nepal, there is a tendency among most of the traders to go after the bonus shares blindly and declaration of good bonus is usually met with high enthusiasm, citing the increase in number of shares as a result of bonus shares.\\nHowever, many seem to ignore that the bonus issue is basically just a transfer of amount from Company`s Reserves to Share Capital with the proportionate decrease in EPS and Market Price.\\n\\n6) After today`s announcement, there was huge demand for the script coupled with low supply resulting in the script hitting positive circuit breaker as soon as the market opened and the same was maintained throughout the day. \\nThere was only negligible transaction of 3922 shares while the Demand for more than 10 lakh shares, most of which at positive circuit price of Rs 774, remained unfulfilled.\\n\\n7) In the last 20 days:\\n- there has been high increase in volume I.e the Shares of 45 crores have been purchased, and\\n- the price has increased by more than 65% (467 on 28.4.2021 to 774 on 17.5.2021). \\nBased on above facts, this clearly seems like a classic case of Insider trading.\\n\\n#My_prediction \\n(Based on my experience in the market)\\n\\n1) The share price of Radhi is expected to increase for a few more days and expected to remain around 900 before book close of AGM. \\n\\n2) The insiders will then sell their shares at around Rs 900, bagging upto 100% profit within a month earning tens of crores. \\nHere, the buyers are mostly new and unsuspecting investors who purchase the share in the market for huge bonus.\\n\\n3) After book close, the adjusted price shall be somewhere around 600s (900/1.365). \\n\\n4) After Bonus, the EPS of the company is expected to be around Rs 13 and Net Worth Per Share around Rs 115. \\nNext year, the company can announce maximum 10% bonus shares. Till then, the price is expected to gradually decrease to 200-300s over time.\\n\\n#Insider_Trading_In_Nepal\\n\\n1) Insider trading is the trading of a Company`s securities based on the non-public information that is likely to affect the price of securities when made public. \\nGenerally the directors, management personnel of the Company etc have access to these price sensitive information like Bonus, Rights, Quarterly report, mergers and acquisition etc. before they are made public. They then make investment decisions based on such information and also pass down the information to others.\\n\\n2) Although illegal, Insider trading is widely rampant in Nepal. The unusual movements in Share price and transaction volume can be clearly seen in case of each Company days before the price sensitive information like bonus, right, financials are made public.\\nThis seems largely due to the failure on part of SEBON to investigate and prosecute these cases, thus encouraging those involved in insider trading.\\n\\n3) In Nepal, \\nSection 101 of the Securities Act, 2063 provides for the punishment to a  person convicted of Insider Trading as follows:\\n- Fine equal to the amount in Controversy OR,\\n- Imprisonment upto 1 year OR\\n- Both\\n\\n4) In India,\\nSection 15G of the SEBI Act 1992 provides penalty for Insider trading as follows:\\n- Penalty upto Rs 25 crore OR\\n- 3 times the amount of profit made from insider trading, \\nwhichever is higher.\\nFurthermore, they shall also be punishable for Imprisonment upto 10 years.\\n\\n5) In USA,\\n- Criminal Penalty- Prison upto 20 years and fine upto $ 5 million ($ 25 million for Cos)\\n- Civil Penalty- Upto 3 times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of insider trading.\\n\\n6) The regulation in case of China is even more stringent. Other countries have strong laws on insider trading and prosecute the offenders on a regular basis with imprisonment for years and fines in millions of dollars.\\nHowever in case of Nepal where the Insider trading happens openly on a daily basis, the rampant insider trading hardly goes punished.\\n\\n7) In the recent case of Insider trading of Ajod Insurance, SEBON finally established a committee to investigate the same. However, it seemed like SEBON did not perform any action suo-motu for many days. \\nOnly after wide public outcry and the direction from Finance Ministry, it seemed like SEBON was compelled to do the same.\\nThe investigation onto the same is still ongoing and not finalized.\\n\\n8) Even though this case of Ajod Insurance was highly publicized as it was apparent to everyone, one can clearly see on a daily basis that there is no less insider trading going on in each of the other companies listed in NEPSE. However they all go unchecked and unpunished.\\n\\n9) Thus it is safe to say that the Insider trading is flourishing due to the lack of Surveillance, investigation and prosecution from SEBON.\\nThis is even more astounding on the light of the fact that one of the major functions of SEBON is the \"Prevention of Insider trading and protection of investors\" as per Section 5(o) of the Securities Act, 2063. \\n\\n#Conclusion:\\n\\nInside trading is a despicable crime which results in the unfair markets where the insiders earn huge profits within a short period of time with virtually no risk, while all that at the expense of the ordinary investors.\\n \\nIn case of Nepal since the same goes unchecked and unpunished, the insiders are more and more encouraged to indulge in this White Collar crime and have earned billions at the expense of the ordinary investors.\\n\\nHere are some suggestions to SEBON & Govt to curb the same:\\n\\n1) Perform continuous Market Surveillance activities and initiate investigation suo-motu where foul play is suspected.\\n(Other stocks like PROFL, RHPC, BBC etc. have unusual trading in recent days)\\n\\n2) Implement more stringent laws on Insider Trading and establishment of Separate Autonomous body to investigate all such cases.\\n\\n3) Provide a clear message to all the stakeholders that Insider trading is a despicable crime and shall not go unpunished.\\n\\nAt last,\\nRampant insider trading erodes public confidence in the market and impedes its functioning. It also promotes corruption and slowly turns the nation towards a failure state.\\nसक्ने जतिले देश छोड्ने अनि भ्रष्ट र निरीह मात्र यहाँ बस्ने दिन नआओस् ।\\n\\nThus, let us put the interests of the country and people at large before our short term personal interests.\\nLet us raise our voice against the malpractices like insider trading where we suspect one.\\nLet us work to ensure that the capital market is a fair playing field for all. \\nLet us focus on analysis and investment rather than rumors and speculation.\\n\\nRemember:\\n- \"Evil prevails when good men fail to act.\"\\n- \"In a corrupt environment, an honest person has a hard time,\\nIn an honest environment a corrupt person has a tough time.\"\\n\\nआफ्नो बिचार Comment गर्नु होला,\\nसाथै चित्त बुझेमा Share पनि गर्नु होला ।', 'created_utc': '2021-05-18T06:56:55', 'num_comments': 14, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/nexa3t/must_read_article_on_radhi_by_bibek_poudel_i/', 'flair': 'Market', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': \"NICA's fall must be studied\", 'score': 79, 'id': '1gx8irg', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/tl5i0f51mg2e1.jpeg', 'author': 'captainright1', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2024-11-22T19:47:16', 'num_comments': 24, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/1gx8irg/nicas_fall_must_be_studied/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'dubaayooo bhaii leyy.............', 'score': 78, 'id': 'ok7sxy', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/opx78m1ue7b71.jpg', 'author': 'tprototype_x', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-07-14T22:05:59', 'num_comments': 1, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/ok7sxy/dubaayooo_bhaii_leyy/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Happy New Year fellow investors of r/NepalStock', 'score': 79, 'id': 'mqhufk', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalStock/comments/mqhufk/happy_new_year_fellow_investors_of_rnepalstock/', 'author': 'umbrella_beach', 'body': \"I've only been in this sub for a couple of months.

For beginners, it might be the optimal trading approach since its pace is slower than day trading, which gives traders more time to monitor every position and find the best entry points.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njuhbe6ludj61.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b74afe31d624e2788a7167ef1fa58ab9405043f3\\n\\nIn swing trading, the positions are held overnight and can stay open for days or weeks. In the following lines, we’ll discuss the most popular swing trading indicators used in cryptocurrency trading. All of them have been borrowed from forex and stock trading, which proves their versatility.\\n\\n>Swing trading *indicators are technical analysis tools that highlight specific aspects of the price action to improve traders’ decision making. All technical indicators analyze the price from various perspectives based on historical data, so it would be inaccurate to say that they can predict the future*.\\n\\n**What Is A Swing Trading Indicator?**\\n\\nA swing trading indicator is a piece of analysis tool that uses mathematical calculations to determine various aspects of the price action based on historical data. We call a swing trading indicator any technical analysis indicator implemented on a daily chart or any other chart used by swing traders to assess the market situation.\\n\\nTechnical analysis indicators help traders figure out whether the trend is bullish or bearish and whether it has momentum, among others. While some swing traders use to trade the news and rely on fundamental analysis, technical indicators are imperative to determine the best entry and exit points. Ultimately, a swing trader uses these indicators to formulate or identify the perfect strategy to maximize profits.\\n\\n**The three most important types of swing trading indicators are the following:**\\n\\n**Trend indicators** – these indicators show you which direction the market is going and whether we can distinguish a trend at all. Generally, trend indicators are used to smooth price volatility to highlight the primary trend. Moving averages are the most well-known example of trend indicators.\\n\\n**Momentum indicators** – momentum indicators show how strong a trend is and whether a reversal might be on the horizon. They can also show the overbought and oversold levels. The most famous examples of momentum indicators are the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\\n\\n**Volume indicators** – volume is an important indicator that shows how many traders are buying and selling an asset at any given time.\\n\\nUnderstanding How Swing Trading Works.Before getting more in-depth with analyzing the best indicators for swing trading, let’s go back to the swing trading process.\\n\\nSwing trading is a trading style that comprises various strategies and behaviors that share some common aspects closely related to the time of a trade. While it is typically applied in forex and stock trading, it can go well with cryptocurrencies too.\\n\\nWith swing trading, you will hold your position open for several days or weeks, as long as the trend carries on in your favor. Traders would be interested in closing their position when the trend shows signs of reversal. Given that swing traders operate with larger timeframes, they are not interested in the short-term price volatility the same as day traders do. For swing traders, the only thing that matters is that swing highs go higher in a bullish market while swing lows go lower in a bearish market.\\n\\nSwing high and low as part of swing trading indicators.\\n\\n**What Are Swing Highs?**\\n\\nSwing highs are consecutive peaks touched by the price before fleeting moments of retracement. Sometimes the retracement can turn into a trend reversal, which breaks the consecutiveness of the swing highs. When the current swing high is higher than the previous peaks, we can distinguish a general uptrend.\\n\\n**What Are Swing Lows?**\\n\\nSwing lows are consecutive lows that succeeded by the temporary moments of rebounds. When the current low is lower than the previous ones, we can determine a general bearish trend.\\n\\nSome swing traders prefer to trade between swing highs and lows only, which usually becomes a shorter-term version of swing trading.\\n\\n**The Importance of Swing Trading Indicators**\\n\\nWhile swing traders don’t rely on technical indicators as much as day traders do, there is no doubt that they can’t succeed without them. Swing trading indicators are fundamental and make up the essential tools in the arsenal of a trader.\\n\\nUsing a reliable technical indicator or a combination of them can increase trading signals’ accuracy by multiple times. Trading without indicators is like walking with eyes closed.\\n\\n**Best Swing Trading Indicators**\\n\\nWe have compiled the best swing trading indicators that stand out due to their simplicity and efficiency of trading signals. However, it’s worth mentioning that in no way can they guarantee you consistent profits. That’s mainly because technical indicators don’t predict the future but help you better visualize the present and past. \\n\\n**Here are the six most popular and reliable technical indicators used in swing trading:**\\n\\n**1. Relative Strength Index (RSI)**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10bfs5c5udj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3362dd77f5634b217f196278bc6420de65a4d4e4\\n\\nRelative strength index (RSI) chart as an analytic indicators for swing traders.\\n\\nThe RSI one of the most important crypto trading indicators. As a momentum oscillator, and you may find it under the category of ‘oscillators’ on your chart. It calculates the size and magnitude of the latest price changes. Swing traders use the RSI mostly to determine the overbought and oversold levels.\\n\\nThe indicator is displayed as an oscillator, i.e., a line graph that moves between two extremes and can range between 0 and 100. The RSI line ascends when the number and size of bullish closes go up, and it declines when the magnitude of losses increases.\\n\\nThe most straightforward RSI signal occurs when the indicator breaks above the 70 levels; it suggests an overbought level and might anticipate an uptrend’s reversal. If the RSI enters the zone below the 30 marks, then it indicates an oversold market, meaning the bearish trend could end soon.\\n\\nAnother way to use the RSI is to look for centerline crossovers. For instance, when the indicator breaks above its centerline, it points to a rising trend.\\n\\n**2. Moving Averages**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0904iev7udj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53be1b6083d05cbc8728e6ca6081e673636f3387\\n\\nMoving average technical indicators  chart visualization.\\n\\nMoving averages (MAs) are the first technical indicators that have been used for decades in the analysis of commodities and company shares. As the name suggests, they calculate the average of an asset’s price movement over a given period. As a result, MAs smooth out the short-term volatility that may confuse traders.\\n\\nIt’s important to understand that MAs are lagging indicators and rely on past price action. Thus, it would help if you used them to confirm a trend rather than predict future moves.\\n\\nWe can distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term MAs, depending on how many periods they monitor. For example, short-term MAs have a period between 5 and 50, while medium-term MAs have up to 100.\\n\\nThere are two main types of MAs: simple moving averages (SMAs) and exponential moving averages (EMAs). The latter emphasizes the more recent price action.\\n\\nThe best way to use MAs is to look when a short-term MA crosses a longer-term MA. If the former crosses the more extended MA from bottom to top, this is a bullish signal, and vice versa.\\n\\n**3. MACD**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dzhvyf9udj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8dab70b56d8d6aafed78abe3b02486dbbc9ec9f\\n\\nMACD complex technical indicator.\\n\\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a more complex technical indicator that merges two regular moving averages that we discussed above. The calculation of MACD is by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA, though these parameters can be adjusted manually based on your needs. To be clear, the two lines displayed on the MACD chart do not represent the two MAs used for the calculations. Instead, here are the three elements of the MACD indicator:\\n\\nThe MACD line, which calculates the distance between two MAs;\\n\\nThe signal line, which can spot changes in price momentum and is regarded as a trigger for bullish and bearish signals;\\n\\nThe histogram, which represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.\\n\\nSwing traders would usually buy when the MACD line crosses above its signal line and go short when the MACD crosses below the signal line.\\n\\nAnother way to use the MACD is to look for divergence between the histogram and the price action, which usually anticipates a trend reversal.\\n\\n**4. Volume**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l1l7g2budj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e32374f70cd5ce588ff5983a5d136b70cf895f5f\\n\\nVolume uptrend indicator.\\n\\nVolume is one of the most critical indicators for swing traders, though beginners often ignore it. This indicator can be shown by default below the main chart, and it offers insight into how robust is a newly formed trend. Basically, the volume indicator shows how many traders are buying or selling a cryptocurrency or asset at a given point. Thus, the higher is the volume, the stronger the trend.\\n\\nVolume is especially useful with breakout strategies, i.e. when an asset’s price breaks above a resistance line or below a support line. If the breakout is accompanied by high volume, then the new trend is expected to be substantial.\\n\\n**5. Bollinger Bands**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li3oemlcudj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8759889cfed819725cf0c178b2790002d434564\\n\\nBollinger band indicator in swing trading.\\n\\nThe Bollinger Band (BB) is a momentum indicator that consists of three lines – a moving average and two standard deviations, a positive and a negative one. Swing traders prefer this indicator because it quickly detects a trend, the overbought and oversold levels, and the volatility. Also, it looks nice and clear on the chart.\\n\\nThe width of the BB increases along with the volatility and declines when the market calms down. The closer the bands are to each other, the lower the volatility.\\n\\nWhile Bollinger Bands work well in trending markets, they do a great job when the price ranges, i.e., moving up and down inside a horizontal channel. In this case, when the price touches the BB’s upper line, swing traders may go short. When the price touches the lower line of the indicator, this may precede a rebound. \\n\\nThe point is that the price would always tend to move towards the center of the BB. If the band starts expanding, it means that a new trend is forming, and you shouldn’t be trading in a range anymore.\\n\\n**6. Stochastic**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ecj016eudj61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7de02bd0bda559c2bc773e02ca3eb2133fc133b5\\n\\nStochastic momentum indicator.\\n\\nStochastic is another momentum indicator, and it works quite similarly to the RSI, though it has different calculations. The indicator compares the closing price of an asset to the range of its prices over a certain period.\\n\\nLike the RSI, the Stochastic is represented by a chart between zero and 100. Though in this case, the overbought and oversold zones are above the 80 lines and below the 20 lines, respectively. \\n\\nAnother different aspect is that it consists of two lines rather than just one as in the RSI. One line shows the current value of Stochastic, and the other one is a three-day MA.Traders would use Stochastic to determine the overbought and oversold levels. They will also look for the two lines to cross, which generally anticipates a trend reversal.\\n\\n**Best Swing Trading Tools To Use**\\n\\nThe described trading indicators can do a great job of providing relevant signals, but they will become even more efficient if you combine them with other chart tools. Here are some of them:\\n\\n**Resistance and Support Lines** \\n\\nA swing trader should always operate with resistance and support lines since it’s the most relevant when determining an asset’s price point that has had trouble exceeding in the period. In short, Resistance is an imaginary line that the price finds challenging to break and usually bulls back. The support is an imaginary line made of recent lows, which shows the price stops declining and bounces back. If there’s a breakout within these lines, the price usually moves in the breakout direction.\\n\\n**Patterns**\\n\\nSwing traders can also look for chart patterns, usually observed on candlestick charts. There are two main categories of patterns:\\n\\nTrend continuation patterns, which anticipate the continuation of a trend. Some examples are triangle patterns, rectangles, flags, and pennants.\\n\\nTrend reversal patterns, which signal the reversal of a trend. Some examples are double tops or bottoms and head and shoulders.\\n\\n**When to Start Using Swing Trading Indicators?**\\n\\nAny traders should start using swing trading indicators before opening any position. Generally, you will look for good entry points by using swing trading indicators.\\n\\nIt would also be best if you used the indicators to monitor the positions while they are open. By doing this, you can exit the market at the right time and take the maximum profits.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nSwing trading might be the ideal trading style for beginners, and the indicators can help traders benefit from the price volatility.\\n\\nHowever, even though the price moves in swing trading are idle, you should not ignore the basic risk management techniques. By using a stop loss, you can prevent your balance from being wiped out.\\n\\nSome traders might feel that these indicators don’t work as they expect. Still, technical indicators were not designed to forecast futures price moves with 100% accuracy but to help you make better decisions based on in-depth market insights. \\n\\nReference:google/equiti/bibt.\\n\\nFound a perfect article that can be really helpful for my fellow-beginners..\\n\\nGoodluck!!', 'created_utc': '2021-02-24T13:50:38', 'num_comments': 9, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/lr7axi/common_swingtrading_tools_for_beginners/', 'flair': 'Technical Analysis', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'NIFRA', 'score': 59, 'id': 'lqo930', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/sc79zlo4l9j61.jpg', 'author': 'Angdembey', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-02-23T23:28:55', 'num_comments': 6, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/lqo930/nifra/', 'flair': 'Market', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'NEPSE must change its captcha style.', 'score': 59, 'id': 'lm096d', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/lx9260yos2i61.gif', 'author': 'rajansth7', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-02-17T23:35:50', 'num_comments': 8, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/lm096d/nepse_must_change_its_captcha_style/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'A day in the financial market.....................', 'score': 56, 'id': 'prp8ba', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/7xpup9ylslo71.jpg', 'author': 'Infamous_Magician523', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-09-20T12:21:44', 'num_comments': 0, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/prp8ba/a_day_in_the_financial_market/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': '61 kittey ho ma', 'score': 60, 'id': 'la3bm5', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/j4hab8k3eve61.jpg', 'author': '735026889', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2021-02-01T19:28:08', 'num_comments': 3, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/la3bm5/61_kittey_ho_ma/', 'flair': 'Memes/Fun/Laughs', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': 'Now that others are catching up, this is my last daily dose of treemap.', 'score': 57, 'id': 'tel10f', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/aren9ewfnin81.png', 'author': 'tempervisuals', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2022-03-15T15:12:35', 'num_comments': 13, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/tel10f/now_that_others_are_catching_up_this_is_my_last/', 'flair': 'Market', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': \"Rule number 208: Don't trust the opening price\", 'score': 56, 'id': 'sng548', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/6vnx39a7vkg81.png', 'author': 'tempervisuals', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2022-02-08T15:10:44', 'num_comments': 19, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/sng548/rule_number_208_dont_trust_the_opening_price/', 'flair': 'Market', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}, {'title': '८ महिना अघि अर्थ सरोकारको अन्तर्बर्तामा हरिश दहालको अनुभव २० वर्ष मात्र थियो, ८ महिनामा २५ वर्ष भएछ !! वाह अर्थसरोकार ! वाह प्याकुरेल ! #fakemedia #arthasarokar', 'score': 56, 'id': 's8b60d', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/vzgvrg8q2sc81.jpg', 'author': 'None', 'body': '', 'created_utc': '2022-01-20T11:09:01', 'num_comments': 8, 'permalink': '/r/NepalStock/comments/s8b60d/८_महन_अघ_अरथ_सरकरक_अनतरबरतम_हरश_दहलक_अनभव_२०_वरष/', 'flair': 'Market', 'nsfw': False, 'awards': 0}]\n"
