goes through the christchurch earthquake and she experiences the crucial role facebook has in disaster communication and community support\n4 following initial rejection by facebook executives sarah successfully persuades the company to create the manager of global public policy position for her in the aftermath of the christchurch earthquake\n5 sarah forgets to bring her laptop on her first day because she expects facebook to have computers at the office\n6 sarah has a meeting with the new zealand prime minister where she finds out that mark zuckerberg is disinterested in policy and sheryl sandberg coo can turn on the charm but does not talk about anything substantive\n7 sarah describes a disastrous meeting with german government officials who are suspicious of facebooks data collection methods the germans disapprove of facebooks unfinished office and the situation worsens when a facebook representative makes awkward comments about being jewish and german nude sunbathing habits the failed diplomatic effort foreshadows germanys subsequent investigation into facebook\n8 sarah is shocked by the casual displays of wealth at facebook from assistants wearing louboutins to colleagues considering their salaries meaningless due to stock options that are worth way more\n9 employees are expected to mirror leaders relentless dedication and long hours facebook reinforces this culture with perks and a little red book that promotes a missiondriven familylike atmosphere blurring personal boundaries\n10 a summit is held to determine facebooks first global initiative which ultimately becomes organ donation despite sarahs concerns about its cultural and regulatory complexities the project leads to a power struggle between sheryl and mark over using facebook to promote organ donation sheryl and sarah want to use a popup to promote it but mark doesnt ultimately sarah receives her first direct email from mark which just says i am overruling you\n11 sarah is tasked with taking javier olivan facebooks head of global growth to a summit in colombia with the secret mission of convincing him to stay at facebook after the upcoming ipo during their time in cartagena sarah

easily file a claim online pay a fee and they send you a replacement phone even though my screen was cracke my phone still worked so i just sucked it up and still used it one day i went on my spectrum app and saw that i have the upgrade anytime feature so i was like ok cool i just upgraded my daughters phone i can a new phone too wahoo so i go down to spectrum and im like hi i would like to upgrade my phone the guy was so rude and was like oh no we cant help you cuz your screen is cracked you have to go online and make a claim blah blah blah it literally says online that with the upgrade anytime feature they will take your phone in any condition as long as it has no liquid damage and can still turn on and off my phone didnt have any water damage and can still turn on and off so i was a little upset but i left i got on my phone to make a claim and it wouldnt work so i tried a few more times and it wasnt working so i get on with spectrum chat and they tell me oh we got rid of that feature ok whatt i was not informed about thisshe was like oh we let everyone know blah blah and i was like well no one told me she asked if i heard about the upgrade anytime feature and i said yes i was just at spectrum the day before and they said they couldnt help me because my screen had a little crack in it she said oh no i can help you right now blah blah blah but they would have to mail me the phone and i would have to be home to sign for it but i work during the week so it would be way too hard so i ask if i can do it in person and she said yes and if they give me any problems to let her know this was all on a monday by the way so tuesday i go back down to spectrum and a different person helped me and i was like hi l was here yesterday and the guy was rude and said he wouldnt help me cuz of the crack in my screen and the lady told me the exact same thing shes like oh i cant help you cuz of the crack in the screen im like look i just got off the phone with spectrum and they said you guys will take the phone in any condition as long as there is no water damage and the phone turns on and off it wasnt very busy and luckily the manager was standing close by and looked it up and said literally what i told them and showed them on my phone so finally the lady finally gives me the new phone which is a samsung s24 ultra she plugs in the phones so everything can be transferred over and asked me to go sit on the couches while i wait at first it said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes but then it kept going up and by like 7pm it said it was going to take 12 hours to transfer everything over a different lady was like we close at 8 and you cant stay here so shes like im just going to transfer everything over from your samsung account so i was like ok so that took a little bit longer but she finally called me over and said everything was transferred over she asked me if i needed to check anything before she erased and reset my old phone i saw everything was on my new phone my photos contacts texts facebook snapchat etc so i stupidly said no im good so she gave me my new phone and i left after i had left i stupidly forgot that i had the two step authentication for facebook setup on my old phone that has now been erased so i havent been able to log in to facebook or messenger i am able to get into everything but facebook so not only am i not able to get into facebook i realized that the first lady that was helping me with my phone didnt give me my drivers license back  so i had to go back i had already been there monday had to go back on tuesday because they didnt help me in the first place and now had to go back now on wednesday so i go in and saw the manager and said hey the lady that helped me yesterday never gave me my drivers license back the same girl was there and was so rude didnt say a word didnt smile nothing just gave me my drivers license that she left on the desk anyways sorry for the long post but im so mad at myself i want to cry i want to know if this has happened to anyone else what did you do were you able to get back into your account its literally been almost 3 weeks and i still cant get into my facebook account it keeps saying i have to enter a code from the authentication app doesnt say which one and nothing is coming up on my phone i literally have the same name same email address same phone number etc ive sent a picture of my drivers license to the account recovery and havent heard a word from anyone  i made a new facebook account but i dont want a new one i want my main one its so infuriating ive literally downloaded every single authentication apps and nothing works they so easily verified it was me on my new facebook account but cant for my main one it literally makes no sense to me someone please

cracked you have to go online and make a claim blah blah blah it literally says online that with the upgrade anytime feature they will take your phone in any condition as long as it has no liquid damage and can still turn on and off my phone didnt have any water damage and can still turn on and off so i was a little upset but i left i got on my phone to make a claim and it wouldnt work so i tried a few more times and it wasnt working so i get on with spectrum chat and they tell me oh we got rid of that feature ok whatt i was not informed about thisshe was like oh we let everyone know blah blah and i was like well no one told me she asked if i heard about the upgrade anytime feature and i said yes i was just at spectrum the day before and they said they couldnt help me because my screen had a little crack in it she said oh no i can help you right now blah blah blah but they would have to mail me the phone and i would have to be home to sign for it but i work during the week so it would be way too hard so i ask if i can do it in person and she said yes and if they give me any problems to let her know this was all on a monday by the way so tuesday i go back down to spectrum and a different person helped me and i was like hi l was here yesterday and the guy was rude and said he wouldnt help me cuz of the crack in my screen and the lady told me the exact same thing shes like oh i cant help you cuz of the crack in the screen im like look i just got off the phone with spectrum and they said you guys will take the phone in any condition as long as there is no water damage and the phone turns on and off it wasnt very busy and luckily the manager was standing close by and looked it up and said literally what i told them and showed them on my phone so finally the lady finally gives me the new phone which is a samsung s24 ultra she plugs in the phones so everything can be transferred over and asked me to go sit on the couches while i wait at first it said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes but then it kept going up and by like 7pm it said it was going to take 12 hours to transfer everything over a different lady was like we close at 8 and you cant stay here so shes like im just going to transfer everything over from your samsung account so i was like ok so that took a little bit longer but she finally called me over and said everything was transferred over she asked me if i needed to check anything before she erased and reset my old phone i saw everything was on my new phone my photos contacts texts facebook snapchat etc so i stupidly said no im good so she gave me my new phone and i left after i had left i stupidly forgot that i had the two step authentication for facebook setup on my old phone that has now been erased so i havent been able to log in to facebook or messenger i am able to get into everything but facebook so not only am i not able to get into facebook i realized that the first lady that was helping me with my phone didnt give me my drivers license back  so i had to go back i had already been there monday had to go back on tuesday because they didnt help me in the first place and now had to go back now on wednesday so i go in and saw the manager and said hey the lady that helped me yesterday never gave me my drivers license back the same girl was there and was so rude didnt say a word didnt smile nothing just gave me my drivers license that she left on the desk anyways sorry for the long post but im so mad at myself i want to cry i want to know if this has happened to anyone else what did you do were you able to get back into your account its literally been almost 3 weeks and i still cant get into my facebook account it keeps saying i have to enter a code from the authentication app doesnt say which one and nothing is coming up on my phone i literally have the same name same email address same phone number etc ive sent a picture of my drivers license to the account recovery and havent heard a word from anyone  i made a new facebook account but i dont want a new one i want my main one its so infuriating ive literally downloaded every single authentication apps and nothing works they so easily verified it was me on my new facebook account but cant for my main one it literally makes no sense to me someone please help im going insane any advice ",
