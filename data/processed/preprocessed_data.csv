I am suddenly being tagged in breastfeeding photos no less than 4 times a day,415,"Let me preface this with the fact that my account is as private as humanly possible. There are no public pictures of my baby anywhere on my Facebook. I am in zero parenting or breastfeeding groups, I do not comment or interact with any posts that involve this subject.

The accounts all have similar structures for their names. noun/verb/5 random numbers/OK. The captions are strings of random emojis thrown together. These aren’t random accounts pretending to be people, but rather business pages I guess. 

Is this happening to anyone else, maybe with a different subject matter? I guess it’s not the end of the world because I have to approve the tag before it is shared with friends etc. I am hopeful there is a permanent solution to get this to stop. 

I recently started running ads for a business in no way associated with breastfeeding. My personal Facebook page manages this ad account.

Successfully Recovered Hacked Facebook Account!!! Want to HELP people stuck in the Recovery Loop!,350,"I successfully regained control of my  Facebook account that was hacked 6 days ago after almost losing HOPE! My Facebook account was hacked six days ago. The hacker removed my email ID, and phone number, and changed my password locking me out of my account altogether. Despite trying various methods, even contacting Oculus Meta, I remained stuck in a loop of ID verification, temporary passwords, and codes without making progress.  


**Context:** This is specifically for people who have gotten to the STEP of Uploading ID/passport for identity verification! You need to try to log in from an old device like the Facebook app on your phone,  where your FB login name and Display picture is still shown, even though you have been hacked.  Or, you can try to troubleshoot this by typing your Facebook Name to find your profile.

&#x200B;

**The Solution:**

1. **Change IP Address:** I read on Reddit that changing your IP address is key. After multiple failed attempts from my home, I called a friend for help to try this method. **The idea is to use a different email, laptop, and different IP address from a different location while following these steps.**
2. **Use a Different Email:** Once you get to verification, upload your ID as usual and use your friend's email address, one that isn't linked to any Facebook account.
3. **Change Location and Device:** Once your friend receives the usual email that Facebook sends saying, ""Thank you for confirming your identity"" with the temporary password, ask him to follow the steps on his laptop. Click on the link that says, ""Get Back to the Account"" with this laptop/IP address. **This step is crucial to break the verification loop.**

**This is when the LOOP Breaks.** Now instead of the Usual log-in page that goes nowhere, the ""Secure your Login Details"" page shows up!!

1. **Restore Your Phone Number:**  Once you press Next,  you get an option to add the phone number previously removed by the HACKER. Ask your friend to add your number linked to your hacked account, and Facebook will send a code to your phone!
2. **Log In:**  Now, give the code you received on your device to your friend. Make him enter the code sent by Facebook to your phone number.

**Now you get access to your Facebook Account! The next steps are crucial to take your account back from the Hacker:**

1. **First, go to settings and have your friend add a new email address that is not linked to any Facebook account. You won't be able to Remove the Hacker's Email yet.**  To remove the hacker's email, you'll need your current password, which you don't have.
2. Then, your friend can reset the password with the new email address. Facebook will send an email to the newly added address to change the password.
3. **Remove the Hacker's Email:** With your new password,  your friend can remove the hacker's email and details finally!
4. **Secure Your Account:** After removing the hacker's email, ask your friend to add your phone number and new email, and set up two-factor authentication for added security.

By having your friend, family member or yourself conduct these steps on a different Laptop, location, and IP Address, you can successfully recover your hacked Facebook account and BREAK THE LOOP after submitting your ID with no results! **Good luck, and may this method help many others facing a similar situation!**",1057,Disabled/hacked,False,0,19,3,"Successfully Recovered Hacked Facebook Account!!!

My soon to be ex wife posted some lies on Facebook and it's impacting my job.  Is there a way I can the post taken down?,312,"My soon to be ex wife and I are going through an acrimonious divorce.  I had divorce papers served this past week and she didn't take it well.  After a really angry phone call from her I thought that was that.  

  
However I got an email from my boss this evening about some concerns he had.  Quick history:  I didn't have Facebook but my wife did.  She was the more social of us two and kept up with group chats and what not via various social medias.  I knew that some of my coworkers and their spouses had become friends with her online because sometimes we all went out to dinners and that's how we set up group dates.   

  
I never really thought about it until the email from my boss.  I'm sorry if I'm rambling I""m just not sure what I need to include.  Before I left my wife, she accused me of cheating.  Which I had not done.  Then she accused me of sleeping with her daughter, who I raised since childhood.  She's my daughter too as far as I'm concerned.  That was the last straw and I filed for divorce.  

  
My ex announced our divorce on a Facebook post claiming that she left me because I abused her and our daughter and that my daughter has left the country because she's so ashamed.  From what I gather, my coworker's wife saw it, she told him, he told my boss, my boss told me.  

  
There has to be steps I can take but I have no idea what they are.  My boss, thankfully, knows me and knows it's not true.  But I have no idea how this is going to impact my job, what my coworkers think, what their spouses think.  It's just one shit moment after another and I don't know what to do.  I made a Facebook account and reported the post but I have no idea if that's going to go anywhere.  I've emailed my attorney, but it's Sunday so I won't hear back from them until at least tomorrow but possibly not for a couple of days.

It's really depressing to think about what happened to FB and how it ruined so many lives,289,"Growing up as a Millenial, I remember FB being this place that allowed you to have a glimpse into your friend's lives. 

We got to see what their life was like and understand them better and grow closer as humans. 

You got to learn their favorite foods, who their parents were etc without leaving your home. 

....at least that WAS the plan. 

It instead created jealously and hatred. And people who were mentally unstable teenagers or depressed could just post whatever they wanted which well..you get it. 

Random strangers could add you or message you dick pics or threatening messages

But for a while it was nice, you actually formed friendships and made friends. Like actual friends. With people from all around the world ! 

But then you started to realize who was actually your friend and who just wanted an add. 

You realized that nobody cared about what you posted or they DID care and not in a good way. 

Then businesses started shilling pages and filling feeds instead of friends, so if you liked Taco Bell you'd get spammed with posts from the page. 

Then the groups thing started and oh, Sarah from HS is posting nudes. 

And the 2016 election came and oh Mike unfriended me for my political views

My best friend bobbert from HS suddenly hates me because of a post I made about how orange juice is superior to coffee. 

Oh ads. Fun. 

Now I'm scared to post anything for fear of a ban or somebody unfriending me, fun!   

I deactivated my account early this year because its just depressing to see what it became. 

All my HS friends either deactivated, deleted or abandoned their accounts. 

FB ruined itself because it decided to become more authoritarian and private then what it set out to be. 

A place for people to connect and just be friends. 

Now what's the point? If you're like me and almost 30 you know all your friends from HS either have families now or don't use FB anymore and your family that isn't mom and pop is either dying/dead or disowned you for political reasons. 

Do you really want to log on to see Sarah from HS posting a photo of her 3rd baby from her 5th baby daddy? Or your cousin posting a picture of a sandwich for lunch? 

Do you really want your friends to hate you for posting about something you're passionate about? 

Facebook isn't fun anymore and definitely isn't even close to what it was in the early 2010s 

There isn't anymore fun anymore. It feels like a prison you are forced to be happy in. 

Why? Because you're looking though a window to other people's lives though a steel barred window while trapped in your own. 

People don't add anymore for fear of hacking or harassment and nobody checks message requests. 

You can't even add strangers anymore unless you have 1 or 2 mutual friends

There is no more connecting. There is no more trust. 

Facebook is a shadow of what it used to be. 

Somebody once described FB as an abandoned theme park full of dead memories and honestly I think that's the most fitting description 

If we never had FB I honestly think the world would've been a better place.

How to quit Facebook. The platform has gone down the road too far.  ,249,"I've been on Facebook for more than a decade. It's been a good tool to connect with my old friends and laugh at memes. However, increasingly, almost all contents are AI generated or pirated from original creators baiting for ad revenues. They don't deserve that money. It's full of scams from 3rd world countries too.

Hacked accounts posting porn on my mom's wall and she is absolutely traumatized,238,"My elderly mom has been crying non-stop since 2 days and she was just lying in bed thinking it is somehow her fault that a hacked account (someone in her friends list) tagged her in a hard-core porn video which appeared on her wall.

She is now embarrassed to go outside because people who know her might judge her. I explained how it happened technically and that nobody cares, but still she can't believe it.

The post has been removed since then, but she wanted her account deleted, so I gladly did that for her. Seriously, how the hell did Facebook let his happen? Aren't there any safety mechanisms in place?

Later edit: I know there are privacy settings to prevent anyone from directly posting on her wall. That's the first thing I enabled immediately in the ~~after-math~~ aftermath and before initiating the account deletion. But still, it is surprising that Facebook doesn't detect explicit content like that and prevent the posting from happening in the first place.

"Successfully recovered hacked Facebook account!!! (changed contact info, 2FA)",236,"Well, I learned my lesson. A 15 year old password that was part of hundreds of leaks that I had reused countless times does not provide much security. Honestly though, I thought that I had changed that password a while back. If you're reading this, you've probably already realized you need to step up your personal security. I have been using Bitwarden and Authy since this, and I really like both of those so far.

Anyways, my account got hacked Jan 8. I was on the road for work, and it was hacked early in the morning. I did not have a chance to immediately address the issue. The hacker changed my password, removed my email and phone number, and set up 2FA. I went through the usual password recovery methods and realized that the recovery email was not one that belonged to me. I tried the other suggestions on Facebook's help pages, but as I'm sure you well know by now, Facebook customer support is not a thing. I tried using Trusted Contacts. This *almost* worked. I was able to access my account, but as I was clicking through the recovery screens, I got an error message saying the link I used was expired. Damn. I tried a couple more times, but got messages saying something about exceeding the # of attempts to recover in a day. The next day, Trusted Contacts is no longer an option. Instead, I go through the process of submitting an ID and an alternate contact email. And then I wait. And wait. And wait. I keep checking back, and all I ever see is, ""You have already submitted your ID. We will get in contact when we have a chance to review."" Fast forward to a month later, I check back and get a new message. ""Your account cannot be recovered because we cannot confirm your identity."" No further steps mentioned. No details or other options on how to confirm my identity - just a brick wall. I searched all over and found lots of people in the same boat who had just said, ""Forget it!""

Now what you actually came for. Here's what worked for me:

I realized that I have a free account, so I am literally worthless to Facebook. So how do you get their attention? Oculus (the virtual reality gaming platform) is owned by Facebook, and Facebook account is required to register and use an Oculus. And Oculus has live chat support. Without an account, they've just sold you a $300-$400 paperweight. Only problem, they don't much care unless you have actually purchased an Oculus product and have a serial #. So I pull out my Target app, find the Quest 2, and purchase it for contactless curbside pick-up. Less than 2 hours later, I am back on chat support with my new Oculus serial number, and they are able to submit a direct request to Facebook support. Maybe an hour later, I finally get an email from Facebook support. They request identification, which I quickly supply, and almost immediately I receive back a link to recover my account! Facebook re-associated my account to my email address, and I was able to change my password. Bingo! Until I hit the hackers 2FA. It takes me to a page where I can bypass the 2FA by submitting an ID. (Wait, didn't I already do this?!) I submitted that, and also sent another email back to Facebook support. After not hearing back for 24 hours, I responded again to the Oculus support ticket describing my issue. No less than an hour later, I get another email from FB with a link to bypass 2FA.

I was able to successfully get back into my account, remove the hacker's email address (which was cleverly chosen to mimic my own), disable the hacker's 2FA, and reset everything with my own info. It doesn't look like the hacker actually did much with my account while they had it, but I went though all of my groups, activity history, etc. to see what I could find or if there was any other damage control I needed to do.

Now I'm set up with a unique, 12+ digit randomly generated password, 2FA, log-in alerts, and Trusted Contacts reset. I've gone though many of my online accounts and done the same with all of them. I use Facebook for communication, entertainment, and to connect with different communities and businesses, so for me, it was mostly just an annoyance. I know some people rely on it for business, and my have other important accounts connected to it. Regardless of how you use FB, I wanted to post my success story so that hopefully it can help of the other folks out who are having to deal with the same thing. If you've got any questions, feel free to post or message me. Dealing with FB has been a pain in the ass, and I would be glad to help. I'm heading back to Target now to return my leverage!

Facebook timeline has turned from a place I connect with friends and family into complete trash,220,"This is a partial rant about what Facebook has developed into in recent years. And things are getting worse.

The reason why Facebook was great in the ""good old times"" was that it allowed you to connect with friends and relatives, see what they are doing and share with them what you do. Or following companies you want or be part of groups which share your interests.

But right now, my Facebook timeline is just utter nonsense. The algorithm is so broken, that +90% of the posts on my timeline is utter trash I have no interests in. It actually seems that most of the posts are generated by bots, with images clearly generated by AI. Using the ""Show less"" option next to such posts brings no improvement and I just get different AI generated trash shown to me.

The most infuriating thing is, that posts from my friends, or groups I am part of show with delay of several hours or even days - some don't show at all, I actually have to open the profile of the person or the group to get to see such posts. Facebook seems to just prefer to show me random posts I never shown any interest in due to the simple fact, that such posts have higher engagement - even if it comes from bots too!

Add to it, that Facebook now automatically refreshes your timeline at will and if you had some posts which you hoped to look at later, you just can't. Cause that damn algorithm refreshes your timeline several times an hour and you just can't return to something you have seen in the morning.

Unfortunately, there is no option like on X to only see posts from people you follow. Honestly, at this stage I would be ready to pay for such option on FB, and just get rid of all the spam FB thinks I should see and like. It is utterly unenjoyable and makes me consider leaving FB cause I just can't take more of it.

I honestly think Zuckerberg is trying to kill off Facebook and wants nothing to do with it.,211,"With the recent news of Mark Zuckerberg announcing Meta is getting rid of fact-checkers, I was disheartened but also found some relief that it's going to cause a mass exodus from the platform and it will hopefully wither away. 

Honestly I don't care about fact checking on Facebook, the platform isn't designed to be a news source, but to share about your life. I don't rely on Facebook for any 'facts', for me this move is just going to incentivize for trolls to spam the platform. I don't want to see that crap, I was just here to keep up with friends and family.


As someone who made their account when I was 12 in 2007, it was an awesome, yet imperfect way to keep up with friends. Keeping connected to people you know was its sole purpose. I have Facebook to thank for marry my wife because it was how we kept in touch after meeting one night at camp. Honestly if Facebook stayed this way, I'd still love it. But greed took over as they found ways to make millions by hooking our attention through doomscrolling. Over the years it gradually started to steer of its original purpose to by the mid-2010's it had a become more of a marketing, media and news outlet, and no longer about fostering connection. Now ten years later if check my feed it's mostly ads, pages I don't follow, reels and weird Ai slop and less actual friends posting. 

I honestly think Zuckerberg doesn't care about Facebook, has little to no interest in social networking and just sees it as funding for his true passion, the Metaverse. If Zuckerberg did truly care about connecting people, he wouldn't have let it devolve to what it has become now. This past year everyone I know has abandoned Facebook and with this recent news more and more people are going to abandon it. Facebook has gotten him into countless lawsuits that I can imagine he no longer feels it's worth it. It's almost like he is purposefully trying to sabotage it so he can be wash his hands from it and move on.
