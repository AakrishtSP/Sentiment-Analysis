for your motherboardmodel please visit and check if it has been updated recently uefis bios updates are commonly released in waves as such it can take a series of motherboards weeks or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding uefi bios update issued furthermore remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation an update may only apply to a specific model how long are motherboards supported with uefi bios updates how long should i monitor for an update in most cases after a year boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates mature releases can often be seen within the first six months all nonbeta releases pass qualification and validation if you feel you have an issue dependent on a uefi release please submit a support ticket some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months also user experience can vary considerably based on endusedefined parameters and system configurations such as overclockingperformance tuning users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues i want to update but i am unsure how to update the uefi bios if you want guidance on how to flashupdate your uefi bios please watch the video linked below it will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashingupdating the uefi bios how to flash update your uefi bios on asus motherboards should i update the uefi if my system is stable and running without issue if your system is running without issue especially if overclocked in any way including dram it is recommended you stay on the buildrelease you are on changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the oc experience and require you to retune a previously stable oc value this does not mean the uefi is not a functioningreliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system as many of these values are lowlevel it is best to retune from uefi defaults verifying the uefis system stability is also recommended via a stress test like passmark burnin test occt aida64 or a similar stress test users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience will a uefi update improve my overclocking experience a uefi update can improve multiple aspects of the oc experience whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them improving general system stability or adding new options relative to overclocking it is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors including silicon variance which cannot be overcome purely from a uefi update will a uefi update change my operating experience power consumption temperatures etc changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like cpu boosting behaviors there can also be changes to uefi bios auto rules a uefi bios update can affect operating temperature performance scores power consumption etc comparisons should be made at liketolike values ideally meaning the same settings applications etc it is also recommended this occur at f5 defaults sometimes you may need to reinstall the os after a uefi bios update to gauge its stability correctly this means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values f5 and ideally a fresh installation of chipset drivers an updated build of windows and a nonmodified windows power profile what if the uefi bios listed is a beta should i update beta uefi releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features functions microcode enhancements and overall uefi improvements they are not recommended for daytodaylongterm use users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperabilitycompatibility stability and performance should wait for a formal release not every user should updateflash their uefi bios again if you are running without issues you are advised to stay on the release you are running notes to consider when flashing please perform the update process at uefi bios defaults do not flash with an overclocked systemprofile your warranty is still applicable under the use of a uefi bios update 1 i recommend updating the uefi bios on your motherboard for new pc builds this helps to ensure the best interoperability compatibility and performance if you are building a pc and have not installed the os i recommend updating the uefi 2 remember that flashingupdating the uefi will reset all defined parameterssettings and operating profiles you cannot restore defined values using a uefi profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds you should note or screenshot f12 your values before flashing if they are complex upon completing a flash i recommend you load uefi defaults after the fact perform a reboot and shut down before reloading or entering any customized uefi values 3 when you update the uefi and reload uefi defaults depending on your defined initial boot values you may need to adjust csm settings enabling or disabling csm if you experience bootrelated issues after an update please change the csm accordingly 4 be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior uefi is not possible this can occur when an update includes a cpu microcode such as an amd aegsa or intel me this means you may be unable to flashback to a prior release 5 while not always necessary some uefi updates may require clearing the cmos to reset the uefi and ensure normal functionality you may need to clr the cmos to have the system post after you flash you can clear the cmos via the clr cmos button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard cmos battery for at least a few minutes you can also attempt to locate the clr cmos jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the cmos 6 some updates will cause pcie remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllersdevices in these cases you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers graphics drivers or other pcie or usb linked based devices it is also recommended you back up your system before any flashupdate ideally it would be best to load uefi bios defaults f5 before performing a flashupdate do not flash with an overclocked configuration ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded f5 defaults the board modelname is on the righthand side and the version number is on the lefthand side to download the uefi bios please go to amd uefi bios releases 1 b850m ayw gaming wifi 0312 2 prime b850mk 0403 3 pro ws wrx90esage se 0901 4 rog crosshair x870e apex 1203 5 rog crosshair x870e extreme

experiencing any issues including but not limited to games or programs crashing system crashes or hangs blue screens of death bsod driver timeouts system not starting system freezes data corruption system shutting down unexpectedly visual artifacts lower than expected performance or any other issue please read and try the following before making a post the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below the suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order if a step has already been performed or is not relevant please move to the next step if your system wont power on make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet andor power supply are in the on position its also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet if you have any power related issues like your system not starting shutting down sleeping restarting or waking from sleep try to test with another power supply as unstable voltages such as on the 12v 5v 5vsb and 33v rails can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose make sure your memory modules ram are installed in the primary dimm slots as some motherboards will not post poweron selftest if the memory is installed in the secondary dimm slots the primary dimm slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual if your system does power on but wont get past the post screen please ensure your cpu ram and gpu are installed correctly and try clearing the cmos this can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the cmos battery for a few minutes some motherboards may also have clear cmos reset jumpersbuttons you can use please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the cmos if your system still wont post check if your motherboard has a debug led and consult your motherboard manual to check what step its stuck on make your motherboard is compatible with the cpu you have most am4 and am5 motherboards should have bios flashback which will allow you to update the bios without needing a cpu or ram installed consult your motherboard manual as the bios flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model when using bios flashback we recommend using a usb 20 drive that is 8gb or less and formatted as fat32 as some implementations of bios flashback dont work reliably with usb 30 drives andor usb drives that are larger than 8gb if you are using an amd radeon rx 6000 amd radeon rx 7000 nvidia geforce rtx 30 or nvidia geforce rtx 40 gpu please ensure you are using separate 68pin pcie cables and not using daisychained or splitter cables as these may not be able to supply sufficient power some gpus may have led indicators by the connector to let you know if the gpu isnt receiving adequate power please consult your gpu and psu manual for more information on how to correctly power your gpu make sure your monitortv is plugged into the hdmi or displayport output from your graphics card and not the motherboard if this still doesnt work try a different monitortv if you are using any hdmi or displayport adapters converters or splitters remove these and use a direct connection try switching between hdmi and displayport and try different hdmi or displayport cables to rule out any problems here for best results always use certified hdmi or displayport cables make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system games and applications scan your pc for any viruses or malware using windows security formerly windows defender or other reputable antivirus or antimalware solution as malware viruses adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes freezes hangs and other performance security stability and compatibility issues make sure you are running the latest amd chipset andor graphics drivers some devices such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware ids or other manufacturer changes in which case you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturers support page if you need to reinstall gpu drivers we recommend using the amd cleanup utility or display driver uninstaller ddu to perform a clean installation of the gpu drivers a guide on how to use ddu can be found here if you have installed gpu drivers after using the amd cleanup utility or ddu you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again if windows update is replacing your gpu drivers example of what that looks like here please view the following thread on the steps you can take to resolve and prevent this happening in future if you are on windows 10 or windows 11 and experience flickering stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled try disabling multiplane overlay mpo as some users have reported this has resolved their issues more information on disabling mpo is available in this thread if a game is crashing freezing not starting performing poorly or having other issues please verify and repair the game files through steam epic games store ubisoft connect ea app gog galaxy battlenet or whichever game client you are using if a program is crashing freezing not starting performing poorly or having other issues please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installeruninstaller if you are on windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance make sure you are using the balanced or high performance power plan and restore them to their default values this can be checked under control panel system and security power options make sure you are using the latest bios firmware and drivers for your motherboard laptop desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system these updates often contain bug fixes new features and improve compatibility and interoperability if you have any overclocks underclocks overvolts undervolts custom power curves or similar revert everything to stock clocks timings voltages and settings this includes disabling xmpexpodocp to do this go into your bios and restore the factory settings this is typically labelled restore default restore optimized defaults load optimized defaults or some similar variation if you are using other utilities like msi afterburner or ryzen master you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well if you are using windows 10 or windows 11 use the builtin system file checker sfc and deployment image servicing and management dism commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them a guide is available here if you have a custom built pc recently upgraded started overclocking or want to know if your current psu will support a hardware upgrade please use one of the below psu calculators and make sure the psu you have or intend to buy can supply enough power when your system is under full load if your psu isnt able to supply enough power you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load psu calculators fsp outervision cooler master seasonic newegg be quiet msi you can also add all your components into pcpartpicker and it will provide an estimate wattage try and apply common sense to an issue for example if you have flickering on your tv or monitor try simple things like changing the hdmi or displayport cable and port on the gpu and display you are using if youve recently installed a mod and that game now crashes uninstall that mod if one of your memory modules is no longer being detected is there any physical damage to the memory module dimm slot on the motherboard or pins have you tried reseating it etc if you experience crashes freezes unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below remember that just because your system turns on doesnt make it stable and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your cpugpuram you should always thoroughly stability test your system many reading this post
