driver feedback directly to nvidia link here\n\nrnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here\n\nhaving issues with your driver read here\n\nbefore you start  make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue\n\nthere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here\n\nadditionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia\n\ncommon troubleshooting steps\n\n be sure you are on the latest build of windows 10 or 11\n please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install\n if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel  managed 3d settings  power management mode prefer maximum performance\n\nif it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk\n\n a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to 2009 thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards\n unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem\n additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool\n\nif you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma\n\ncommon questions\n\n is it safe to upgrade to insert driver version here fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver\n\nbear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed\n\n my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel  change resolution  scroll all the way down  output dynamic range  full\n my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu\n what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx 1080 keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor\n\nremember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad",
