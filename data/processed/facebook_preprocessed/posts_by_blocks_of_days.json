trafficking case mark focuses on pr about privacy over his employees wellbeing 1 mark didnt have a theory of how he and the company should be in the world he didnt really have developed opinions about policy or politics beyond sign up more users the rest of facebooks leadership wasnt very different mark really couldnt be bothered to care now hes developed priorities and theyre mostly pretty horrible and ignorant of the human costs 38 after traveling to jo\u00e3o pessoa brazil for work sarah endures months of fear that she may have contracted zika virus while pregnant only to later

about the disturbing trend of politicians like duterte using facebook for misinformation campaigns her concerns are ignored by leadership who prioritize the revenue from controversial political advertising 41 if anything facebook rewards outsider candidates who post inflammatory content that drives engagement we charge less money for ads that are more incendiary and reach more people trump is using our system the way its designed to be used from my point of view thats incentivizing and rewarding the worst kinds of political ugliness joel doesnt seem to care at all its all money and what harm does it do he tells us its clear clintons going to win anyway 42 after trumps victory joel supports the outcome while concerned employees questions about social impact and facebooks role in spreading misinformation are dismissed company leadership publicly denies any facebook influence on the election results despite having previously promoted facebooks electoral influence internally 43 mark travels to the apec summit in peru to gain exposure to global politics facebook builts a replica of his meeting room at the summit many world leaders are solicitous seeking his partnership but

inappropriate behavior to retaliate joel reduces her responsibilities and forces her to lead the china team 1 when i take a business trip to one of our overseas offices one of my coworkers pulls me aside as soon as i arrive wed worked together for years and id noticed her cheerful personality change when she was moved under a new boss a balding pale man around the same age as joel she closes the door and issues a quick warning about him her face reddening as she says dont be alone with him stick to the openplan office and dont let him talk to you about sex stuff later the same man begins an affair with a young coworker who wanted to join the team he was leading she subsequently left the company hes still there 49 sarah uncovers disturbing documents revealing facebooks strategy to gain entry into china by promising surveillance and censorship support to the chinese government 1 facebook employees will be responsible for user data responses that could lead to death torture and incarceration facebook employees will be responsible for directly responding to requests for data from a government that does not respect international standards for human rights 50 facebook under the codename aldrin partnered with hony capital a chinese private equity firm codenamed jupiter to enter the chinese market agreeing to store user data in china and develop censorship tools to comply with chinese government demands this included building facial recognition content moderation and emergency censorship switches while also sharing advanced technological insights with chinese entities despite rejecting similar data storage demands from other countries 51 facebook devised an intricate plan to enter the chinese market it included managing potential negative publicity preparing evasive answers for scrutiny from the us congress and allocating funds to neutralize potential critics like human rights watch 1 the chinese communist party has told them exactly how it would apply its laws and regulations and facebook has developed technology and tools to meet their requirements and tested them together with the ccp then he mark says no decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible future service might be offered in china he lies 52 facebook bowed to chinese government pressure and censored critic guo wengui while publicly misrepresenting the

completely indifferent to the rules 54 when a leaked document reveals facebooks practice of targeting vulnerable teens for advertising the companys response was to downplay and deny the issue internal

workplace culture deteriorates as employees grapple with moral implications of the platforms negative global impact 56 sarah laments the companys lack of basic decency when she witnesses a contractor convulsing on the floor while employees ignore her and continue to work 57 facebooks inaction in myanmar characterized by inadequate language support and insufficient content moderation directly contributed to the spread of misinformation and hate speech that fueled realworld violence against the rohingya this allowed facebook to become a tool for genocide 1 ive spent a lot of time thinking about what unfolded next in myanmar and facebooks complicity it wasnt because of some grander vision or any malevolence toward muslims in the country nor a lack of money my conclusion it was just that joel elliot sheryl and mark didnt give a fuck 58 at an offsite company event joel calls sarah sultry and grinds on her she reports the incident but the company turns against her fabricating performance issues and firing her leaving her fearing for her familys future 59 sarah emphasizes that without addressing past coverups and systemic issues the industry risks repeating harmful patterns
