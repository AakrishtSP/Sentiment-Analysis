        "score":236,
        "body":"Well, I learned my lesson. A 15 year old password that was part of hundreds of leaks that I had reused countless times does not provide much security. Honestly though, I thought that I had changed that password a while back. If you're reading this, you've probably already realized you need to step up your personal security. I have been using Bitwarden and Authy since this, and I really like both of those so far.\n\nAnyways, my account got hacked Jan 8. I was on the road for work, and it was hacked early in the morning. I did not have a chance to immediately address the issue. The hacker changed my password, removed my email and phone number, and set up 2FA. I went through the usual password recovery methods and realized that the recovery email was not one that belonged to me. I tried the other suggestions on Facebook's help pages, but as I'm sure you well know by now, Facebook customer support is not a thing. I tried using Trusted Contacts. This *almost* worked. I was able to access my account, but as I was clicking through the recovery screens, I got an error message saying the link I used was expired. Damn. I tried a couple more times, but got messages saying something about exceeding the # of attempts to recover in a day. The next day, Trusted Contacts is no longer an option. Instead, I go through the process of submitting an ID and an alternate contact email. And then I wait. And wait. And wait. I keep checking back, and all I ever see is, \"You have already submitted your ID. We will get in contact when we have a chance to review.\" Fast forward to a month later, I check back and get a new message. \"Your account cannot be recovered because we cannot confirm your identity.\" No further steps mentioned. No details or other options on how to confirm my identity - just a brick wall. I searched all over and found lots of people in the same boat who had just said, \"Forget it!\"\n\nNow what you actually came for. Here's what worked for me:\n\nI realized that I have a free account, so I am literally worthless to Facebook. So how do you get their attention? Oculus (the virtual reality gaming platform) is owned by Facebook, and Facebook account is required to register and use an Oculus. And Oculus has live chat support. Without an account, they've just sold you a $300-$400 paperweight. Only problem, they don't much care unless you have actually purchased an Oculus product and have a serial #. So I pull out my Target app, find the Quest 2, and purchase it for contactless curbside pick-up. Less than 2 hours later, I am back on chat support with my new Oculus serial number, and they are able to submit a direct request to Facebook support. Maybe an hour later, I finally get an email from Facebook support. They request identification, which I quickly supply, and almost immediately I receive back a link to recover my account! Facebook re-associated my account to my email address, and I was able to change my password. Bingo! Until I hit the hackers 2FA. It takes me to a page where I can bypass the 2FA by submitting an ID. (Wait, didn't I already do this?!) I submitted that, and also sent another email back to Facebook support. After not hearing back for 24 hours, I responded again to the Oculus support ticket describing my issue. No less than an hour later, I get another email from FB with a link to bypass 2FA.\n\nI was able to successfully get back into my account, remove the hacker's email address (which was cleverly chosen to mimic my own), disable the hacker's 2FA, and reset everything with my own info. It doesn't look like the hacker actually did much with my account while they had it, but I went though all of my groups, activity history, etc. to see what I could find or if there was any other damage control I needed to do.\n\nNow I'm set up with a unique, 12+ digit randomly generated password, 2FA, log-in alerts, and Trusted Contacts reset. I've gone though many of my online accounts and done the same with all of them. I use Facebook for communication, entertainment, and to connect with different communities and businesses, so for me, it was mostly just an annoyance. I know some people rely on it for business, and my have other important accounts connected to it. Regardless of how you use FB, I wanted to post my success story so that hopefully it can help of the other folks out who are having to deal with the same thing. If you've got any questions, feel free to post or message me. Dealing with FB has been a pain in the ass, and I would be glad to help. I'm heading back to Target now to return my leverage!\n\nGood luck!",

A 15 year old password that was part of hundreds of leaks that I had reused countless times does not provide much security. Honestly though, I thought that I had changed that password a while back. If you're reading this, you've probably already realized you need to step up your personal security. I have been using Bitwarden and Authy since this, and I really like both of those so far.\n\nAnyways, my account got hacked Jan 8. I was on the road for work, and it was hacked early in the morning. I did not have a chance to immediately address the issue. The hacker changed my password, removed my email and phone number, and set up 2FA. I went through the usual password recovery methods and realized that the recovery email was not one that belonged to me. I tried the other suggestions on Facebook's help pages, but as I'm sure you well know by now, Facebook customer support is not a thing. I tried using Trusted Contacts. This *almost* worked. I was able to access my account, but as I was clicking through the recovery screens, I got an error message saying the link I used was expired. Damn. I tried a couple more times, but got messages saying something about exceeding the # of attempts to recover in a day. The next day, Trusted Contacts is no longer an option. Instead, I go through the process of submitting an ID and an alternate contact email. And then I wait. And wait. And wait. I keep checking back, and all I ever see is, \"You have already submitted your ID. We will get in contact when we have a chance to review.\" Fast forward to a month later, I check back and get a new message. \"Your account cannot be recovered because we cannot confirm your identity.\" No further steps mentioned. No details or other options on how to confirm my identity - just a brick wall. I searched all over and found lots of people in the same boat who had just said, \"Forget it!\"\n\nNow what you actually came for. Here's what worked for me:\n\nI realized that I have a free account, so I am literally worthless to Facebook. So how do you get their attention? Oculus (the virtual reality gaming platform) is owned by Facebook, and Facebook account is required to register and use an Oculus. And Oculus has live chat support. Without an account, they've just sold you a $300-$400 paperweight. Only problem, they don't much care unless you have actually purchased an Oculus product and have a serial #. So I pull out my Target app, find the Quest 2, and purchase it for contactless curbside pick-up. Less than 2 hours later, I am back on chat support with my new Oculus serial number, and they are able to submit a direct request to Facebook support. Maybe an hour later, I finally get an email from Facebook support. They request identification, which I quickly supply, and almost immediately I receive back a link to recover my account! Facebook re-associated my account to my email address, and I was able to change my password. Bingo! Until I hit the hackers 2FA. It takes me to a page where I can bypass the 2FA by submitting an ID. (Wait, didn't I already do this?!) I submitted that, and also sent another email back to Facebook support. After not hearing back for 24 hours, I responded again to the Oculus support ticket describing my issue. No less than an hour later, I get another email from FB with a link to bypass 2FA.\n\nI was able to successfully get back into my account, remove the hacker's email address (which was cleverly chosen to mimic my own), disable the hacker's 2FA, and reset everything with my own info. It doesn't look like the hacker actually did much with my account while they had it, but I went though all of my groups, activity history, etc. to see what I could find or if there was any other damage control I needed to do.\n\nNow I'm set up with a unique, 12+ digit randomly generated password, 2FA, log-in alerts, and Trusted Contacts reset. I've gone though many of my online accounts and done the same with all of them. I use Facebook for communication, entertainment, and to connect with different communities and businesses, so for me, it was mostly just an annoyance. I know some people rely on it for business, and my have other important accounts connected to it. Regardless of how you use FB, I wanted to post my success story so that hopefully it can help of the other folks out who are having to deal with the same thing. If you've got any questions, feel free to post or message me. Dealing with FB has been a pain in the ass, and I would be glad to help. I'm heading back to Target now to return my leverage!\n\nGood luck!",
