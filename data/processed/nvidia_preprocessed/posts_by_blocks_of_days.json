driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows 10 or 11 please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed 3d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to 2009 thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to insert driver version here fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx 1080 keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad",

continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically written articles babeltechreviews the nvidia rtx 5060 ti is a competent midrange gpu that brings incremental improvements over its predecessor especially when leveraging dlss 4 it performs well at 1080p and 1440p and offers solid gains if coming from a 30series or older card content creators also benefit from enhanced nvenc support for faster 422 video encoding its compact design low power draw and frame generation capabilities make it a practical choice for mainstream gamers and small form factor builds however for a new generation card the performance gains are modesttypically around 1015 over the rtx 4060 timaking it a hard sell unless priced at or below msrp if prices drift north of 449 amds rx 7700 xt or 7800 xt become better buys with more vram and stronger raster performance ultimately the rtx 5060 ti is a fine choice at the right price but fails to impress as a major step forward wait for discounts or consider stepping up to an rtx 4070 super or amd 7800 xt if your budget allows digital foundry article digital foundry video with our testing complete the rtx 5060 ti 16gb is a tricky card to judge given that its performance differentials can swing substantially based on the game and even game scene tested based on our game selections though the card is in the same territory as the rx 7800 xt with an average 22 percent lead over the rtx 4060 ti 8gb at 1440p thats one of the biggest genongen gains that weve seen going from ada lovelace to blackwell but its worth considering that the rtx 4060 ti didnt really shift the needle when it came to beating its predecessor for those upgrading from prior cards in the same class theres around a 37 percent increase over the rtx 3060 ti from 2020 meanwhile versus the 2019 vintage rtx 2060 super youre getting double the performance in both cases the dlss 4 feature set is appealing and id consider the rtx 5060 ti a fine upgrade there elsewhere the rtx 5070 is significantly faster than the rtx 5060 ti 16gb to the tune of a mighty 38 percent my results also see the rtx 4070 beat the rtx 5060 ti by 11 percent though overclocking can make up most of the difference in many games based on the rtx 5060 tis overall performance the card is solid enough but hardly spectacular meaning that price comes into focus looking at dollars per frame based on msrp its disappointing that the rtx 5070 offers better value and i cant help but think there ought to have been a single 16gb or even 12gb model at 399 despite the 128bit bus 3gb memory modules do exist that would have unlocked 12gb as a potential option though its unclear whether theyre available in the quantities and prices needed for a budget gpu so as we keep saying the rtx 5060 ti is a bit tricky the 8gb card on mixed benchmarks will provide better value than the 16gb version overall and compares more favourably to the rtx 5070 on the flipside we just cant recommend the 8gb card given how often were running into vram issues with many games especially upon launch the 16gb version is the one to have then but with the 5070 offering 35 to 43 percent better performance at only 28 percent more money youre again funnelled towards the higherpriced offering though 120 extra is a significant step up in this sector of the market i just wish that nvidia understood that value is supposed to increase the further down the stack you go not decrease the pcie situation is also not great with the 5060 tis 8x lanes translating into some noticeable performance degradation on older pcie 30 motherboards due to bandwidth limitations while the majority of users will be using these cards with modern motherboards with pcie 40 or 50 slots these more budgetoriented cards are more likely to be used with similarly lowend or just antiquated motherboards compared to higherend gpus our testing shows up to a 20 percent performance drop in indiana jones and the great circle at 1080p with less sizeable doubledigit percentage drops in f1 24 and singledigit percentage drops in black myth wukong ultimately there are question marks over value but the rtx 5060 ti is worth taking a look at eteknix article eteknix video so a bit of a tangent but back on track the 3060 ti was a good card when it came out but is definitely showing its age and with the 5060 ti sitting 29 ahead overall theres definitely a viable option to buy it especially as 3060 tis are still holding their price for some weird reason the 4060 ti however sees the 5060 ti around 19 faster and while and im sure nvidia will be happy for me to say this it has multiframe generation upscaling which works some kind of voodoo magic but people still arent sold on it but the tide is turning somewhat if nvidia came in with a gpu that offered a 30 generation uplift or higher in rasterisation and higher in raytracing gen on gen plus mfg then yes i think it would be much better received but thats not the case and instead if youre already on a 40 series card i cant say theres an argument to upgrade to any 50 series with maybe the exception being the rtx 5090 but thats in a whole different league beyond that people are looking for a reason to upgrade and i dont know about you but im getting a bit bored of saying things like its good but or you should buy it if you can get it for x the argument is wearing a bit thin i will say that the 5060 ti on paper if you take pricing out of the equation does come across as a good performer it even sits ahead of the 3070 ti and thats what we want to see the other issue is amd at that price point amd are the better buy but again and i swear this will be the second to last time i say it but amd cards are inflated too so ill leave you with one piece of advice and its a big one regardless the 5060 ti is good but it feels like its much the same as weve seen with the rest of the stack if the price is right and youre not already on a 40 series card then theres an argument but if the price isnt right andor youre already on a 40 series card then maybe give this one a miss unless mfg really tickles your fancy for now thats going to wrap up another 50 series gpu review with a notsoeasytounderstand conclusion id like to think weve at least shown you the facts and that you can make an educated decision as to what to do from there based on that allimportant word price guru3d the rtx 5060 ti is built around a rasterizer shading engine and includes 4608 cuda cores it stems from the rtx 50 series which introduces a new generation of ray tracing and tensor cores positioned close to the shader engine these rt cores never pause as they produce vivid lighting shadow and reflection effects although tensor cores sometimes seem tricky to measure in terms of raw benefits their influence becomes obvious when paired with dlss3 and the updated dlss4 the 50 series represents more than a mere upgrade it stands as a leap forward that meets different gaming requirements whether someone is immersed in 2k 2560x1440 gaming or venturing into the realm of 4k 3840x2160 the rtx 5060 ti adapts when you enable dlss4mfg in baseline performance depending on where and what you measure expect reference cards to be 15 faster than the 4060 ti and oc models closing in at perhaps 20 for the fastest locked and configured models the rtx 5060 ti steps onto the stage immediately ingraining gamers with very decent frame rates sure it might lag slightly behind some close competitors when it comes to standardized shading but overall the graphics performance is solid enough whats interesting is that the improvement isnt uniform across all games one title might skyrocket with huge frame rate gains while another enjoys just a modest boost but the real star of the show is nvidias heavy investment in artificial intelligence deep learning and neural shading technologies activate dlss4 with frame generation set at 4x if possible and the difference is obvious right awayit feels like catching a glimpse of gamings future yet theres a lingering question among gamers is the community ready to fully embrace these aipowered enhancements technology evolves so quickly these days and some players are hesitant to fully rely on machine learning to boost their gaming visuals and performance however early adopters arent holding back theyre diving right in as more players see what dlss4 can achieve particularly in new visually demanding games the excitement is sure to spread theres no doubt about itdlss4 is impressive and early performance data backs this up gamers using ultrawide or 1440p monitors will especially appreciate how every pixel gets pushed to its limits and those chasing ultimate 4k experiences will also find plenty to love by combining the raw power of the rtx 5060 ti with dlss4s dynamic upscaling games can now achieve frame rates that were once considered impossible while some might label the rtx 5060 ti as just a mainstream gpu its actually much more versatile it comfortably handles highend aaa games without breaking a sweat making it perfect for gamers who dont always need every setting maxed but still want smooth impressive performance additionally content creators and professionals using gpuheavy tasks like video editing or 3d rendering will find the 5060 series quite capable its powerful cuda cores speed up rendering giving creators valuable extra time of course true enthusiasts might already have their eyes set on the higherend 5070 ti or 5080 models but the rtx 5060 ti hits a better price point for most pc gamers priced around the 429 mark the nvidia geforce rtx 5060 ti seems promising enough whether it becomes your next favorite gpu depends on how expensive itll sell once it hits the shelves but overall its a product series that we can recommend if youre coming from the rtx 3000 or equivalent graphics card era hot hardware like some of the other members of the geforce rtx 50 series the new geforce rtx 5060 ti offers a modest upgrade in rasterization performance over its previousgen counterpart if we dont factor in newer technologies and dlss 4 with multi frame generation the geforce rtx 5060 ti is about 20 faster than the geforce rtx 4060 ti for the millions of gamers still using lowerend or older xx60 class cards however geforce rtx 5060 ti would be significant upgrade not only is the geforce rtx 5060 ti much faster than older cards for gaming but its got better display output support a more capable media engine and its power requirements are modest enough that most folks wont need a psu upgrade either just stick with the 16gb version if youve got the budget 8gb cards are going to be much more limited moving forward with an msrp of 429 the geforce rtx 5060 tis introductory price comes in a bit higher than 8gb geforce rtx 4060 ti cards but below 16gb variants that were introduced later assuming gamers will be able to get their hands on geforce rtx 5060 tis for prices approaching msrp it represents a good value and a significant upgrade for gamers and creators still rocking rtx 30 series or older cards in the same class as weve mentioned with the other geforce rtx 50 series cards the geforce rtx 5060 ti is faster more capable and more powerefficient than its previous generation counterpart and anyone that likes tinker will have plenty of fun overclocking without leveraging dlss 4s multi frame generation its generational performance uplift is smaller than what weve seen from nvidia in the past though igors lab the geforce rtx 5060 ti 16 gb tested today marks the current entry of nvidias blackwell architecture into the midrange segment and takes on the established competition with the new gb206300 chip while the 8 gb version can hardly be meaningfully tested in modern scenarios due to the limited memory configuration the 16 gb version is the focus of all meaningful analyses the gpu is based on four 32bit memory channels and uses the clamshell method to expand capacity allowing a total of eight 2 gb gddr7 modules to be used despite identical bandwidth to the 8 gb version of 448 gbs at 28 gbps memory clock this results in improved suitability for memoryintensive applications but without an increase in memory bandwidth the gaming performance of the rtx 5060 ti 16 gb is convincing in current titles especially when dlss 4 and frame generation are activated in a direct comparison with the rtx 4060 ti 16 gb the new card is 23 percent ahead on average with ai functions enabled and still around 17 to 18 percent ahead without factory overclocking the strong increase in minimum frame rates p1 low is remarkable where up to 36 percent lead was measured this leads to a significantly more stable gaming experience especially at wqhd resolution efficiency has been noticeably improved as performance is clearly higher with comparable power consumption under full gaming load the average power consumption is between 155 and 165 watts while the power limit of 180 watts is generally not exhausted even under extreme conditions the card remains thermally and electrically stable my test with the msi geforce rtx 5060 ti gaming trio showed that highquality board partner designs can exploit the full potential of the gpu the card comes with factory overclocking which results in around 2 to 3 percent more performance than a reference card the cooling design with four heatpipes a solid copper block and a fin array with a high air flow rate ensures low gpu temperatures of around 63 c in gaming mode the memory modules remain below 68 c also thanks to the generous cooling through the backplate and via separate pads acoustically the card remains very quiet at around 31 dba under load with only a minimal audible whirring of the coils the power supply via a total of eight phases delivered stable voltage values even with manual overclocking all in all the geforce rtx 5060 ti 16 gb can be characterized as a modern midrange gpu which is primarily aimed at users who do not want to do without the latest technologies such as dlss 4 reflex 2 and ray tracing but do not want to spend 500 euros or more on a graphics card with an rrp of 429 us dollars the card is significantly lower than the rtx 4060 ti 16 gb at market launch and also offers more memory better efficiency and a modern architecture it is a particularly attractive option for upgrades from the rtx 3000 or rx 6000 generation the 8 gb version on the other hand should be viewed critically as it quickly reaches its limits especially in wqhd and memoryintensive scenarios and cannot provide a complete picture of the performance of this gpu generation even if you can perhaps save a oneoff 50 usd in other words a card with two faces where the only slightly cheaper offer is clearly the worse one in view of the different markets nvidia wont care about this only the customer should really be sensitized kitguru article kitguru video nvidias rtx 5060 ti is the latest in a long line of blackwell gpus to hit the market arriving in both 8gb and 16gb flavours i was only sent 16gb models for this review and it didnt sound like 8gb variants would be particularly prevalent at retail upon launch probably for the better considering a 8gb gpu launching at 379 sounds like madness to me but back to the 5060 ti 16gb its a curious gpu that epitomises the term mixedbag on the one hand rasterisation performance is solid for 1080p and even 1440p gaming though the latter resolution becomes more of a challenge if you stick to ultra settings however compared to the rtx 3060 ti were only looking at a 31 uplift for 1080p rasterised gaming and thats a gpu which launched at the end of 2020 almost five years ago its clearly underwhelming and exemplifies the struggle for meaningful performance increases that this market segment has been crying out for that said in the context of todays market i dont think the rtx 5060 ti 16gb is a bad product after all its still delivering circa 15 gains over its predecessor the rtx 4060 ti 16gb which actually sounds decent compared to some other blackwell gpus like the rtx 5070 which is just 15 ahead of the rtx 4070 super as much as we may want larger generational gains thats just not the reality for the 50 series given it remains on tsmcs 4n node so i do think we need to be realistic with expectations it also helps that the rtx 5060 ti 16gb is launching with at the lower price point of 399429 the 4060 ti 16gb initially hit the market at 479 though it did later drop below 450 but even against that figure were looking at an 11 price drop there is of course a fair bit up in the air around pc hardware prices right now but i do at least have some confidence that this price point will be achievable after seeing the rtx 5070 in stock at msrp over the last couple of weeks heck its even been on sale for less than msrp so wed hope for more of the same this time around of course the rtx 3060 ti comparison gets much more favourable when looking at ray tracing performance largely thanks to having double the vram 8gb cards these days just cannot deliver certain experiences when ray tracing is enabled resulting in the 5060 ti 16gb being multiple times faster in titles like indiana jones and the great circle you could make the case that the rtx 5070 is the biggest threat to the rtx 5060 ti 16gb its readily in stock at msrp offers performance thats some 3540 better depending on the game and its not too much more expensive sitting at 529 that said its priced high enough to still be out of reach for many in which case the rtx 5060 ti 16gb becomes the obvious choice around the 400 mark for now at least so no it hasnt blown me away and you can easily argue that the product itself is fairly underwhelming but in this market segment nvidias rtx 5060 ti 16gb is our new goto recommendation just dont get the 8gb model please a final word on the two cards tested today palits infinity 3 is a capable model its clearly built to hit the msrp and as such is fairly light on features but it runs quiet and cool so i cant really complain gigabytes aorus elite is a much more premium offering sporting rgb lighting dualbios and a metal backplate while the cooler is more sophisticated resulting in even lower thermals and noise levels than the infinity 3 i dont have a confirmed price for it yet but its almost certainly going to come in well above msrp so as good as it is be careful not to overpay as the 5070 could make more sense if the pricing creeps closer to 500 lanoc tbd pc world article pc world video tbd techpowerup for this launch weve updated our test setup again and retested all comparison cards with the newest drivers we also updated the bios on our 9800x3d and added several new games like our first rt exclusive title indiana jones and path tracing is now an additional section in all reviews at 1440p with pure rasterization without ray tracing or dlss we measured a 13 performance uplift over the rtx 4060 ti 16 gb which is quite small at 4k the increase is bigger reaching 20 a genovergen improvement of 13 is not much but at least its more than rtx 5080 which only got 8 at 1440p the rtx 5090 5070 ti and rtx 5070 did better giving you an extra 20 at 1440p compared to the rtx 3060 ti from two generations ago the performance uplift is only 31 usually we expect a doubling in performance over two generations with these numbers the rtx 5060 ti ends up a bit faster than amds aging radeon rx 7700 xt 11 behind the rx 7800 xt which is much more expensive of course nvidias rtx 5070 nonti is a whopping 39 faster the rtx 5060 ti does not catch last generations rtx 4070 either which remains 16 ahead if youve seen our manual overclocking results there is a ton of headroom like 15 so i have no idea why nvidia clocked their card so low especially considering the fact that its underperforming by so much the rtx 5060 ti is a fantastic choice for gaming at 1080p full hd especially with a highrefreshrate monitor it also has enough muscle for 1440p gaming in most games at maximum details some of the most demanding titles or when rt is enabled will require you to use dlss though to get a good gaming experience thanks to its factory overclock the asus tuf oc gains an extra 4 in reallife performance over the base rtx 5060 ti which is small but every bit helps of course competing cards achieve similar performance levels with all cards hitting 3 or 4 power consumption of the rtx 5060 ti is good while some other blackwell cards had quite high power consumption in idle multimonitor and media playback this isnt a problem at all here the extra memory chips do increase the power draw slightly but its not enough to worry about in gaming i noticed that all models reach around 160 w without ray tracing which is well below the default power limit of 180 w however when ray tracing is enabled power usage increases and occasionally reaches the power limitstill the rtx 5060 ti is definitely not power starved the fps review tbd tomshardware nvidias rtx 5060 ti 16gb delivers a solid combination of performance for the suggested 429 base msrp however as weve seen with every other gpu launch of the past five months retail prices can be much higher its impossible to separate performance from pricing when looking at the overall value of a gpu and the only thing concrete that we can point to are the msrps except those can run the gamut from being at least moderately accurate to being completely nonsense when the 4060 ti 16gb came out a month after the 8gb variant it felt severely underwhelming neither version was really designed to handle 4k gaming but that was the only place where we measured a significant difference in performance two years later things havent changed too much but the reduced 50 price gap on paper at least between the 5060 ti 8gb and 16gb makes the 16gb a far easier recommendation in fact well go so far as to question why nvidia even felt the need to create an 8gb version yes 8gb will be cheaper and it will also be more limited due to the lack of vram there are games indiana jones and the great circle where you cant even try to run ultra settings on an 8gb card thats an nvidia promoted game that simply crashes to desktop with a video memory error when you try higher settings on the 4060 and 4060 ti 8gb gpus along with a bunch of other previous generation rtx cards the good news with the 16gb card is that memory bandwidth has improved thanks to gddr7 so that its not likely to hit vram capacity or bandwidth limitations 56 more bandwidth than the 4060 ti is a sizeable improvement the fact that most games only show about 15 higher performance indicates that gpu compute is the limiting factor more than bandwidth however but as weve already said numerous times the price difference could very easily end up being more than 50 and factors like on againoff again tariffs limited supply product demand and more could push the 16gb card to the point where maybe it wont be the better choice the rtx 5070 still serves as a ceiling on how much more the 5060 ti 16gb can realistically cost before its too much but with 5070 cards often listed for 700 or more theres a lot of wiggle room right now price and availability will be the key determiners of how good the 5060 ti 16gb looks and that will also vary by market europe and asia might end up with a much different gpu landscape than the us as far as graphics card values go what we can say is that the 5060 ti 16gb isnt a massive generational improvement but it is an improvement its also supposed to be less expensive than its 4060 ti 16gb predecessor those are both good things and stuff like neural rendering dlss 4 and multi frame generation are merely extras that you can use as you see fit now we just wait to see what todays launch looks like how quickly the 5060 ti models sell out and how high prices go our score of 4stars represents a best guess on what the 5060 ti 16gb will look like in the current gpu market obviously prices for all graphics cards new and used are all over the map if the rtx 5060 ti 16gb costs 50 more than the msrp and other cards dont show a similar markup that makes it a worse value and a less desirable card and it would deserve a lower score we cant predict where things will go so pay more attention to the performance and realworld pricing than the single score that weve assigned because uncontrollable factors play into the overall package computerbase german hardwareluxx german pcgh german elchapuzasinformatico spanish video review der8auer digital foundry video
