      "combined_text": "if you dont have a gpu right now its worth considering the 5070 ive been on a 6700xt for the past year was planning to get a 9070xt and then prices went crazy i couldnt stomach the 9070 non xt for 670 or the 5070ti for 900 and eventually ordered a 5070 for 550 even though every review has complained about how terrible of a card it is and how 12gb of vram is unusable at 1440p the card has been completely adequate for me i might need to drop down to highmedium in some games to keep stable fps but its not 350 worse performance than a 5070ti at 1440p if youre at 4k this card will not work for you i can run my 240hz monitor on valorant and fragpunk and i can enjoy the single player games i enjoy in the 7090 fps range even though the 5070ti might be getting 100fps vs 80 ill be honest i cannot tell the difference between those two framerates in gameplay unless im really looking with the uncertainly approaching the pc component space if youre on the fence about it i would encourage you to grab an msrp 5070 from pny or the like before prices go up if you currently dont have a gpu i really think its a worthwhile pickup to tide you over until the market stabilizes",

      "combined_text": "upgrade to 4090 or 5070 ti my current card has died and im looking to source a replacement fairly quickly and two cards available that dont seem like atrocious deals are a gigabyte aero oc 4090 at 1700 or a palit gamingpro 5070 ti at 800 both are new but the 4090 is not from an authorised retailer so im not sure what the warranty situation would be probably whatever 4 years is from date or manufacture whereas the palit would have the 3year warranty id be upgrading from a 1070 so either of these would be a huge jump and i game at 1440p 144hz currently but would probably look to move to 4k in the next year my hesitation with the 4090 is whether its worth spending over 2x more than a 5070 ti now and holding onto the card for longer or saving the money now and upgrading again to another 70 ti or 80 in 34 years though considering how underwhelming the jump from 40 series to 50 series is overall including the 5090 because it seems to only have the performance gains due to being a monstersized chip with the increased power draw to match it may be that a 5070 ti is just as viable 34 years from now would really appreciate any thoughts before i pull the trigger on anything as i just dont know which route to take edit thank you all i really appreciate it i decided to go for the 5070 ti having the warranty is pretty important and mfg is a nice bonus and ultimately its hard to justify spending 1700 on a card that may not have any warranty on it and i agree is not worth over 2x as much ill likely hold on to this card for 34 years and upgrade again which seems a better use of the 900 difference",
